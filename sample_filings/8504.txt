Item 4.  Ownership.

    Reference is hereby made to Items 5-9 and 11 of pages 2, 3, and 4, of
this Schedule 13, which Items are incorporated by reference herein.

    ECM, as general partner and investment manager of EGP and other
client accounts, may be deemed to have the power to direct the voting or
disposition of the Issuer's common stock held by EGP or any such other
accounts.  Therefore, ECM, as EGP's and those other accounts' general
partner and investment manager, and Mitchell S. Levine, as managing
member and majority owner of ECM, may be deemed to beneficially own the
common stock owned by EGP and such other accounts for the purposes of
Rule 13d-3 of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended, insofar as
it or he may be deemed to have the power to direct the voting or
disposition of that common stock.

    Neither the filing of this Schedule nor any of its contents shall be
deemed to constitute an admission that ECM or Mitchell S. Levine is, for
any other purpose, the beneficial owner of any securities to which this
Schedule relates (the "Securities"), and each of ECM and Mitchell S.
Levine disclaims beneficial ownership as to the Securities, except to the
extent of his or its pecuniary interests therein.

    Under the definition of "beneficial ownership" in Rule 13d-3 under
the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, it is also possible that the
individual general partners, executive officers, and members of the
foregoing entities might be deemed the "beneficial owners" of some or all
of the Securities insofar as they may be deemed to share the power to
direct the voting or disposition of the Securities.  Neither the filing
of this Schedule nor any of its contents shall be deemed to constitute an
admission that any of such individuals is, for any purpose, the
beneficial owner of any of the Securities, and such beneficial ownership
is expressly disclaimed.


<PAGE>
CUSIP 292758109                SCHEDULE 13G                  Page 7 of 9

    The calculation of percentage of beneficial ownership in item 11 of
pages 2, 3, and 4 was derived from the Issuer's Form SB-2 Registration
Statement Under the Securities Act of 1933 filed with the Securities and
Exchange Commission on June 26, 2007, in which the Issuer stated that the
number of shares of its common stock, $0.001 par value, outstanding as of
June 21, 2007 was 22,203,256 shares.

Item 5.  Ownership of Five Percent or Less of a Class

    Not applicable.

Item 6.  Ownership of More than Five Percent on Behalf of Another Person.

    ECM serves as general partner and investment manager to certain
client accounts, in addition to EGP, that have the right to receive or
the power to direct the receipt of dividends from, or the proceeds from
the sale of, the Issuer's common stock.  Other than as reported in this
Schedule, no individual client's holdings exceed five percent of that
common stock.

Item 7. Identification and Classification of the Subsidiary Which Acquired
        the Security Being Reported on By the Parent Holding Company

    Not applicable.

Item 8.  Identification and Classification of Members of the Group

    Not applicable.

Item 9.  Notice of Dissolution of Group

    Not applicable.

Item 10. Certification

          By signing below I certify that, to the best of my knowledge
and belief, the securities referred to above were not acquired and are
not held for the purpose of or with the effect of changing or influencing
the control of the issuer of the securities and were not acquired and are
not held in connection with or as a participant in any transaction having
that purpose or effect.
