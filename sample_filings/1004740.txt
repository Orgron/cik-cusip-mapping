ITEM 5.  INTEREST IN SECURITIES OF THE ISSUER.

     (The number of issued and outstanding shares of the Issuer's common 
stock upon which the various percentages set forth in this statement on

subsidiaries, commenced acquiring shares of the Issuer's common stock, and on

percent or more of the Issuer's outstanding common stock.  A Schedule 13D was 
filed on August 15, 1997, by the acquiring subsidiary detailing this event.  
The Issuer then issued additional shares of its common stock.  The Reporting 
Person continued to acquire shares of the Issuer's common stock through a 
subsidiary, and on August 27, 1997, began acquiring shares of the Issuer's 
common stock for its own account.  On September 5, 1997, the Reporting Person
