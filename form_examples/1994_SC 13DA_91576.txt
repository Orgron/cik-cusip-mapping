     THIS FIRST AMENDMENT TO AGREEMENT AND PLAN OF MERGER AND TO SUPPLEMENTAL
AGREEMENT TO AGREEMENT AND PLAN OF MERGER (the "First Amendment") is made and
entered into as of this 22nd day of December, 1993, by and between KeyCorp, a
corporation organized and existing under the laws of the State of New York
("KeyCorp"), and Society Corporation, a corporation organized and existing

     WHEREAS, KeyCorp and Society have entered into an Agreement and Plan of
Merger, dated as of October 1, 1993 (the "Merger Agreement"), and a
Supplemental Agreement to Agreement and Plan of Merger, dated as of October 1,
1993 (the "Supplemental Agreement"), which together provide for the merger of
KeyCorp into and with Society, with Society as the surviving corporation under
the name Key Bancs, Inc. (the "Surviving Corporation") and the conversion of
KeyCorp Common Stock into Surviving Corporation Common Stock and KeyCorp Series
B Preferred Stock into Surviving Corporation Class A Preferred Stock;

     WHEREAS, KeyCorp and Society deem it desirable that the definitions of
"Insider Director" contained in the Supplemental Agreement and the Surviving
Corporation Regulations attached to the Merger Agreement as Exhibit II be
amended;

     WHEREAS, KeyCorp and Society deem it desirable that the KeyCorp Stock
Option Plans be assumed, at the Effective Time, by the Surviving Corporation so
that the Surviving Corporation may, if it so elects, grant stock options and
stock appreciation rights thereunder from and after the Effective Time;

     WHEREAS, KeyCorp and Society deem it desirable that certain terms of the
Surviving Corporation Articles of Incorporation attached to the Merger
Agreement as Exhibit I relating to certain voting rights of the preferred
stockholders of the Surviving Corporation be amended;

     WHEREAS, KeyCorp and Society deem it desirable that the Surviving 
Corporation have the name "Key Bancshares Inc." (or such other variant thereof,
including, without limitation, "KeyCorp", as the respective Boards of Directors
of KeyCorp and Society shall mutually determine prior to the Effective Time)
rather than "Key Bancs, Inc."; and

<PAGE>   2
     WHEREAS, KeyCorp and Society deem it desirable that certain of the terms
of the Supplemental Agreement relating to survival of representations,
warranties, obligations, covenants, and agreements beyond the Effective Time be
amended.


                             STATEMENT OF AGREEMENT

     NOW, THEREFORE, KeyCorp and Society hereby agree that the Merger Agreement
and the Supplemental Agreement be amended as follows:

          Section 1.  Section 1.11 of the Supplemental Agreement is hereby
amended to read as follows:

          "Insider Director" shall mean, with respect to Society, any person
     who, as of immediately prior to the Effective Time, was a current or
     former officer of Society or any of its Subsidiaries or any predecessor or
     constituent (by merger, consolidation, or otherwise) of Society or any of
     its Subsidiaries, and, with respect to KeyCorp, any person who, as of
     immediately prior to the Effective Time, was a current or former officer
     of KeyCorp or any of its Subsidiaries or any predecessor or constituent
     (by merger, consolidation, or otherwise) of KeyCorp or any of its
     Subsidiaries, but shall not include H. Douglas Barclay or Henry S.
     Hemingway.

          Section 2.  The last sentence of the second paragraph of Section 1 of
Article II of the Surviving Corporation Regulations attached to the Merger
Agreement as Exhibit II is hereby amended to read as follows:

     "Insider Director" shall mean any person who, as of immediately prior to
     the Effective Time, was a current or former officer of the Corporation or
     any of its subsidiaries or any predecessor or constituent (by merger,
     consolidation, or otherwise) of the Corporation or any of its
     subsidiaries, but shall not include H. Douglas Barclay or Henry S.
     Hemingway.

          Section 3.  Section 4.4 of the Merger Agreement is hereby amended by
designating the existing text of Section 4.4 as paragraph "(a)" and by adding
the following paragraph (b) to the end of Section 4.4:

          (b) At the Effective Time, the KeyCorp Stock Option Plans shall be
     automatically and without further action assumed by the Surviving
     Corporation (and thereupon become stock option and stock appreciation
     rights plans of the Surviving Corporation) as follows:  (i) each option or
     right granted under a KeyCorp Stock Option Plan from and after the
     Effective Time shall be

                                      -2-
<PAGE>   3
     solely for or in respect of shares of Surviving Corporation Common Stock,
     notwithstanding any contrary provisions of the applicable KeyCorp Stock
     Option Plan, (ii) the Surviving Corporation and its Compensation and
     Organization Committee shall be substituted for KeyCorp and the Committee
     of the KeyCorp Board of Directors administering the applicable KeyCorp
     Stock Option Plan, and (iii) references to KeyCorp shall be deemed to be
     references to the Surviving Corporation, references to KeyCorp's By-Laws
     shall be deemed to be references to the Regulations of the Surviving
     Corporation, and any similar references shall be appropriately conformed.

          Section 4.  The term "Key Bancs, Inc.", as referred to from time to
time in the Merger Agreement, the Supplemental Agreement, and the exhibits to
each of them, is hereby amended to read "Key Bancshares Inc." in each of such
agreements and exhibits, including, without limitation, in Article I of the
Surviving Corporation Articles of Incorporation attached to the Merger
Agreement as Exhibit I; provided, however, that if the respective Boards of
Directors of KeyCorp and Society mutually agree, prior to the Effective Time,
that a variation of the name "Key Bancshares Inc.", including, without
limitation, the name "KeyCorp", shall be the name of the Surviving Corporation,
each such reference to "Key Bancshares Inc." shall automatically, without
further action by KeyCorp and Society, be replaced with the name agreed upon by
the respective Boards of Directors of KeyCorp and Society.

          Section 5.  The first sentence of Section 2(b) of Part B of Article
IV of the Surviving Corporation Articles of Incorporation attached to the
Merger Agreement as Exhibit I is hereby amended by adding the following
language to the end of that sentence:

     or until non-cumulative dividends have been paid regularly for at least
     one full year.

          Section 6.  Sections 2(c) and 2(d) of Part B of Article IV of the
Surviving Corporation Articles of Incorporation attached to the Merger
Agreement as Exhibit I are hereby amended to read as follows:

          (c)  The affirmative vote or consent of the holders of at least
     two-thirds of the then outstanding shares of Preferred Stock, given in
     person or by proxy, either in writing or at a meeting called for the
     purpose at which the holders of Preferred Stock shall vote separately as a
     class, shall be necessary to effect any amendment, alteration, or repeal
     of any of the provisions of these articles of incorporation or the
     regulations of the Corporation which would be substantially prejudicial to
     the voting powers, rights, or preferences of the holders of Preferred
     Stock (but so far as the holders of Preferred Stock are concerned, such

                                      -3-
<PAGE>   4
     action may be effected with such vote or consent); provided, however, that
     neither the amendment of these articles of incorporation to authorize or
     to increase the authorized or outstanding number of shares of any class
     ranking junior to or on a parity with the Preferred Stock; nor the
     amendment of the regulations so as to change the number of directors of
     the Corporation, shall be deemed to be substantially prejudicial to the
     voting powers, rights, or preferences of the holders of Preferred Stock
     (and any such amendment referred to in this proviso may be made without
     the vote or consent of the holders of the Preferred Stock); and provided
     further that if such amendment, alteration, or repeal would be
     substantially prejudicial to the rights or preferences of one or more but
     not all then outstanding series of Preferred Stock, the affirmative vote
     or consent of the holders of at least two-thirds of the then outstanding
     shares of the series so affected shall also be required.

          (d) The affirmative vote or consent of the holders of at least
     two-thirds of the then outstanding shares of Preferred Stock and, if the
     holders of 10% Cumulative Preferred Stock are entitled to vote on such
     matter pursuant to Section 5 of Part A of this Article IV, the 10%
     Cumulative Preferred Stock, given in person or by proxy, either in writing
     or at a meeting called for the purpose at which the holders of Preferred
     Stock and, if applicable, 10% Cumulative Preferred Stock shall vote as a
     single class shall be necessary to effect any one or more of the
     following:

           (i) The authorization of, or the increase in the authorized
               number of, any shares of any class ranking prior to the 
               Preferred Stock; or

          (ii) The purchase or redemption for sinking fund purposes or
               otherwise of less than all of the then outstanding 
               Preferred Stock except in accordance with a purchase 
               offer made to all holders of record of Preferred Stock, 
               unless all dividends on all Preferred Stock then 
               outstanding for all previous dividend periods shall have 
               been declared and paid or funds therefor set apart and 
               all accrued sinking fund obligations applicable thereto 
               shall have been complied with.

          Section 7.  Section 10.3 of the Supplemental Agreement is hereby
amended by adding the following sentence after the last sentence of said
Section 10.3:

                                      -4-
<PAGE>   5
     Notwithstanding anything to the contrary in this Supplemental Agreement,
     in general, and in this Section 10.3 in particular, and in the Merger
     Agreement, the respective representations, warranties, obligations,        
     covenants, and agreements of the Parties that will survive the Effective
     Time pursuant to this Section 10.3 shall be deemed to be automatically
     amended to the extent necessary to conform to the provisions of the
     Surviving Corporation Articles of Incorporation and/or the Surviving
     Corporation Regulations as either of them may be from time to time amended
     after the Effective Time pursuant to the provisions thereof or applicable
     law.

          Section 8.   Except as amended by this First Amendment, the Merger
Agreement, the Supplemental Agreement, and the exhibits to each of them remain
in full force and effect without alteration or change.

          Section 9.   This First Amendment shall be governed by and construed
in accordance with the laws of the State of Ohio except to the extent the laws
of the Business Corporation Law of the State of New York shall be applicable.

          Section 10.  This First Amendment may be executed in one or more
counterparts, each of which shall constitute one and the same instrument.

          IN WITNESS WHEREOF, each of the Parties has caused this First
Amendment to be executed on its behalf and its corporate seal hereunto affixed
and attested by officers thereunto duly authorized all as of the day and year
first written above.
