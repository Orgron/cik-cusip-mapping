Item 4.	Purpose of Transaction. 
 
	The purpose of Fidelity, FVA, FVAL and FMTC in having the Fidelity Funds

interest in the Company in pursuit of specified investment objectives 
established by the Board of Trustees of the Fidelity Funds and by the

	Fidelity, FVA, FVAL and FMTC, respectively, may continue to have the 
Fidelity Funds and the Accounts purchase Shares subject to a number of 
factors, including, among others, the availability of Shares of sale at what 
they consider to be reasonable prices and other investment opportunities that 
may be available to the Fidelity Funds and Accounts. 
 
	Fidelity, FVA, FVAL and FMTC, respectively, intend to review 
continuously the equity position of the Fidelity Funds and Accounts in the 
Company.  Depending upon future evaluations of the business prospects of the 
Company and upon other developments, including, but not limited to, general 
economic and business conditions and money market and stock market conditions, 
Fidelity may determine to cease making additional purchases of Shares or to 
increase or decrease the equity interest in the Company by acquiring 
additional Shares, or by disposing of all or a portion of the Shares. 
 
	Neither Fidelity nor FMTC has any present plan or proposal which relates 
to or would result in (i) an extraordinary corporate transaction, such as a 
merger, reorganization, liquidation, or sale of transfer of a material amount

stock becoming eligible for termination of its registration pursuant to 
Section 12(g)(4) of the 1934 Act.

beneficially own all 903,691 Shares, reference is made to Item 2 for a 
disclaimer of beneficial ownership with respect to the securities which are 
"beneficially owned" by the other corporations.

approximately 2.31% of the outstanding Shares of the Company, and through

2.31% of the outstanding Shares of the Company.  Neither FMR, Fidelity, FMTC,

combined holdings of FMR, Fidelity, FVA, FVAL, and FMTC, are 903,691 Shares, 
or approximately 12.12% of the outstanding Shares of the Company.

(60) days.
