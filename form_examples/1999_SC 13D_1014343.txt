Item 4.  Purpose of Transaction

     The purpose of the purchase by WAC of 180,000  shares of Common Stock is to
acquire a  significant  equity  interest  in  Laminating  Technologies.  WAC may
utilize this equity interest in Laminating Technologies to pursue one or more of
the courses of action  described  below.  Whether WAC pursues any one or more of
the  following  courses of action will depend on a number of factors,  including
WAC's evaluation of Laminating  Technologies' business,  prospects and financial
condition,  the market for the Common Stock,  other  opportunities  available to
WAC, other transactions entered into or planned to be entered into by Laminating
Technologies,  actions  taken by other  persons  who may be  seeking  control of
Laminating  Technologies,  prospects  for WAC's own business,  general  economic
conditions  and other  future  developments.  The courses of action that WAC may
follow are described below:

     (A) WAC may  decide  to sell all or part of its  investment  in the  Common
Stock in the open market or in private  transactions or by any other permissible
means.  WAC has no  current  intention  to sell  its  investment  in  Laminating
Technologies' Common Stock.

     (B) WAC may elect to hold its current interest in Laminating  Technologies'
Common Stock for investment purposes only.

     (C) WAC may seek to acquire control of Laminating Technologies. WAC has not
formulated  a  specific  plan or  proposal  to  acquire  control  of  Laminating
Technologies  and there can be no assurance  that any such plan or proposal will
be developed or as to the terms or the timing of any such plan or proposal.  Any
such  plan  or  proposal   that  may  be  formulated   could   involve   seeking
representation on the Board of Directors of Laminating Technologies,  purchasing
additional Common Stock in the open market or in private transactions,  making a
tender offer for all or some lesser  amount of Laminating  Technologies'  Common
Stock  or  proposing  a  business   combination   transaction   with  Laminating
Technologies.

         (D) WAC may seek to take  steps that would  impede the  acquisition  of
control of Laminating  Technologies by another person.  WAC has not formulated a
specific  plan or  proposal  to impede  acquisition  of  control  of  Laminating
Technologies by another person, and there can be no assurance that any such plan
or proposal  will be  developed or that WAC will seek to impede  acquisition  of
control of Laminating  Technologies by another person. Any such plan or proposal
may  include  entering  into  voting  agreements  with  other   shareholders  of
Laminating  Technologies,  acquiring additional shares of Common Stock, offering
to pay a premium over another offer received by Laminating  Technologies  or its
shareholders   for  the  Common   Stock,   seeking   amendments   to  Laminating
Technologies'  articles of incorporation,  bylaws or other governing  documents,
seeking to merge  with or acquire  the  assets of  Laminating  Technologies,  or
taking  other  steps WAC  determines  are  necessary  or  appropriate  to impede
acquisition  of control of Laminating  Technologies  by another  person.  In the
event another  person does seek to acquire  control of Laminating  Technologies,
WAC may  attempt  to  impede  that  acquisition,  may  compete  for  control  of
Laminating  Technologies,  may  initially  compete  for  control  of  Laminating
Technologies and subsequently  withdraw its interest in seeking control,  or may
do nothing.

     WAC's  election to pursue any one of the  foregoing  courses of action will
not, by itself, constitute an abandonment of any other course of action. WAC may
pursue  more  than  one of the  foregoing  courses  of  action  sequentially  or
simultaneously.  However,  at the present time WAC has not  formulated a plan to
pursue any of the foregoing courses of action.

     Except as  described  in this Item 4, WAC has not  formulated  any plans or
proposals which relate to or would result in any matter required to be disclosed
in response to paragraphs (a) through (j) of Item 4 of Schedule 13D.
