ITEM 5.  INTEREST IN SECURITIES OF THE ISSUER.

                          On March 1, 1994, the merger of KeyCorp, a New York
corporation ("Old KeyCorp"), and Society Corporation, an Ohio corporation
("Society"), was consummated (the "Merger").  Society, the surviving
corporation of the Merger, was renamed "KeyCorp" upon effectiveness of the
Merger.  This Amendment No. 2 to Society's Schedule 13D relates to the Common
Shares, par value $5.00 per share of Old KeyCorp ("Old KeyCorp Common Stock").
Pursuant to the Stock Option Agreement, dated as of October 2, 1993, and filed
as Exhibit 1 to Society's Schedule 13D (the "Stock Option Agreement"), Old
KeyCorp granted to Society an option to purchase up to 20,229,509 shares of Old
KeyCorp Common Stock.  At the effective time of the Merger, the Stock Option
Agreement was terminated in accordance with its terms, thereby eliminating
Society's beneficial interest in the aforementioned shares of Old KeyCorp
Common Stock.


ITEM 6.  CONTRACTS, ARRANGEMENTS, UNDERSTANDINGS, OR
         RELATIONSHIPS WITH RESPECT TO SECURITIES OF THE
         ISSUER.

                          On March 1, 1994, upon consummation of the Merger,
the Stock Option Agreement was terminated in accordance with its terms.


                                   SIGNATURE

                          After reasonable inquiry and to the best of my
knowledge and belief, I certify that the information set forth in this
statement is true, complete, and correct.

Dated:  March 4, 1994                         KeyCorp (formerly Society
                                                Corporation)
