                   The Dial Corp Employee Equity Trust (the "Trust"),

         spect to the Common Stock, $1.50 par value per share (the

         state Bank of Arizona, N.A., as trustee of the Trust (the 

         "Trustee"), beneficially owns any securities covered by this 

         Amended Statement or is required to file this Amended State-

         beneficial ownership of the securities covered by this 

         Amended Statement.

         Item 5.   Interest in Securities of the Issuer

         
                   The first paragraph of Item 5 is amended to read in 

         its entirety as follows:

         shares of Common Stock, as to which it may be deemed to have 

         shared voting and dispositive power.  Shares of Common Stock 

         acquired pursuant to the Purchase Agreement are held in the 

         Trust's suspense account and will be released as the Trust 

         repays the Note to the Issuer and will be allocated to the 

         accounts of participants in the Plans in the manner set forth 

         in the Trust Agreement."
