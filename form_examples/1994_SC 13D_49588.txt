         (d). Neither Torchmark nor any of the above listed persons have, within
              the last 5 years, been convicted in a criminal proceeding
              (excluding traffic violations or similar misdemeanors).

         (e). Neither Torchmark nor any of the above listed persons have, within
              the last 5 years, been party to a civil proceeding of a judicial
              or administrative body of competent jurisdiction resulting in or
              subjecting them to a judgment, decree or final order enjoining
              future violations of or prohibiting or mandating activities
              subject to federal or state securities laws or finding any
              violation with respect to such laws.

Item 3.  Source and Amount of Funds or Other Consideration:

              On February 11, 1994, Torchmark acquired 4,677,243 shares of
              I.C.H. Common Stock for a purchase price of $23,386,215 in cash.
              The source of the funds was working capital of Torchmark.

Item 4.  Purpose of Transaction:

         Pursuant to the Stock Purchase Agreement, dated January 15, 1994, among
         I.C.H., Consolidated National Corporation, a Kentucky corporation
         ("CNC"), Consolidated Fidelity Life Insurance Company, a Kentucky life
         insurance corporation ("CFLIC"), Robert T. Shaw, C. Fred Rice and
         Torchmark (the "Stock Purchase Agreement"), Torchmark has acquired
         shares in I.C.H. for purposes of investment and has no current plans or
         proposals that relate to, or would result in, a sale of the Common
         Stock purchased; provided, however, Torchmark reserves the right in the
         future to purchase or dispose of its shares of I.C.H. Common Stock in
         open market transactions, private transactions or otherwise.

         (a)  Pursuant to the Stock Purchase Agreement, I.C.H. agreed that in
              accordance with that certain agreement, dated June 15, 1993, as
              amended, among I.C.H., CNC and CFLIC, CFLIC will transfer all
              shares (other than as specified in the Stock Purchase Agreement)
              of I.C.H. equity securities and any securities exercisable for or
              convertible into I.C.H.'s equity securities that are owned by
              CFLIC.

         (d)  Pursuant to the Stock Purchase Agreement, I.C.H. agreed to amend
              its bylaws to eliminate the requirement that the number of
              directors be an integral of four. An officer of Torchmark has been
              elected to the board of directors of I.C.H. as of the closing of
              the acquisition of I.C.H. Common Stock described herein. So long
              as Torchmark owns at least five percent of the issued and
              outstanding shares of Common Stock of I.C.H., I.C.H. will cause a
              person designated by Torchmark to be nominated for election as a
              director of I.C.H. and I.C.H. will use its best efforts to secure
              election of such person as a director to the I.C.H. board of
              directors.

         (e)  Pursuant to the Stock Purchase Agreement, I.C.H. Corporation 
              agreed to use its reasonable best efforts to cause to be filed 
              an amendment to its certificate of incorporation to eliminate
              Class B Common Stock. I.C.H. Corporation also agreed not to reduce
              the number of shares of voting securities outstanding prior to the
              closing of the transaction contemplated by the Stock Purchase
              Agreement.

                   either individually or as part of a "group" as that term is
                   defined in Section 13(d)(3), owns beneficially any shares of
                   the Common Stock.

              (c)  On January 15, 1994, Torchmark entered into the Stock 
                   Purchase Agreement whereby Torchmark agreed to purchase
                   4,677,243 shares of Common Stock of I.C.H. for a purchase
                   price of $23,386,215. This transaction was closed on February
                   11, 1994 and is the subject of this Schedule 13D. Other than
                   as described herein, none of the persons named in Item 2 have
                   effected any transactions in the Common Stock during the
                   preceding 60-day period.

              (d)  Not applicable.

              (e)  Not applicable.

Item 6.  Contracts, Arrangements, Understandings or Relationships With Respect 
         to Securities of the Issuer:

         I.C.H. agreed pursuant to Section 8.15 of the Stock Purchase Agreement
         that so long as Torchmark owns at least five percent of the issued and
         outstanding shares of I.C.H. Common Stock, one person designated by
         Torchmark will be nominated for election as a director of I.C.H. and
         I.C.H. will use its best efforts to secure election of such person as a
         director.
