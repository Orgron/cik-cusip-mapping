Agreement and Plan of Merger, as amended on August&nbsp;28, 2002 and September&nbsp;17,
2002 (the &#147;Merger Agreement&#148;). The Merger Agreement provides for o2wireless to
be merged with and into Baran Acquisition in accordance with the Georgia
Business Corporation Code and the Merger Agreement (the &#147;Merger&#148;). The Merger
is subject to receipt of regulatory approvals, the approval of o2wireless&#146;
shareholders and other closing conditions. As a result of the Merger, each
outstanding share of o2wireless Common Stock will be converted into the right
to receive 0.014919 ordinary shares of Baran. Consummation of the Merger will
result in the termination of registration of the o2wireless Common Stock
pursuant to Section&nbsp;12 of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended.
</FONT>
<P><FONT size="2">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Merger Agreement, as amended, is attached hereto as Exhibits 99.1,
99.2 and 99.3 and is incorporated herein by reference.

of o2wireless Common Stock at a price of $0.45 per share, which is exercisable

wholly-owned subsidiary, Baran Acquisition, has the right, exercisable only in
certain circumstances, none of which have occurred as of the date hereof, to
acquire up to 5,559,610 shares of o2wireless Common Stock, which represent
beneficial ownership of approximately 18.3% of the shares of o2wireless Common
Stock currently outstanding. If Baran were to acquire such shares, it would
have sole voting and investment power with respect thereto. Because of the
limited circumstances in which the Warrant granted under the Warrant Agreement
is exercisable, Baran disclaims beneficial ownership of the shares of
o2wireless Common Stock that are subject to the Warrant Agreement.

<P><FONT size="2">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As a result of the Irrevocable Proxy (discussed in Item&nbsp;6 below), Baran
may be deemed to own 13,348,353 shares of o2wireless Common Stock and options

Stock, together with the shares underlying the Warrant, and the 215,400 shares
of o2wireless Common Stock purchased by Baran in open market transactions,
constitutes approximately 53.88% of o2wireless Common Stock, assuming the
exercise of options to purchase 594,098 shares of o2wireless Common Stock
subject to the Irrevocable Proxy and the 5,559,610 shares subject to the
Warrant. Baran may be deemed to have shared power to vote the shares that are
subject to the Irrevocable Proxy. However, Baran (i)&nbsp;is not entitled to any
rights as a shareholder of o2wireless as to the shares that are subject to the
Irrevocable Proxy and (ii)&nbsp;disclaims any beneficial ownership of the shares of
o2wireless Common Stock which are covered by the Irrevocable Proxy.

beneficially owns any shares of o2wireless Common Stock.

transaction at a price of $0.045 per share. On October&nbsp;2, 2002, the same
wholly-owned subsidiary of Baran purchased 190,400 shares of o2wireless Common
Stock in an open market transaction at a price of $0.05 per share. Except as
described above, there have been no transactions in o2wireless Common Stock by
Baran, or, to the best knowledge of Baran, by any of Baran&#146;s executive officers

<P><FONT size="2">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;On June&nbsp;5, 2002, in connection with the execution of the Merger Agreement,
Baran entered into an irrevocable proxy (&#147;Irrevocable Proxy&#148;) with certain
stockholders and option holders of o2wireless. Each of these shareholders
and/or option holders has agreed to vote all shares of o2wireless Common Stock
beneficially owned or controlled by such shareholder and/or option holder in
favor of the Merger. In the Irrevocable Proxy, each shareholder and/or option
holder also agreed to vote against any action or agreement that would (i)
result in a breach of any covenant, representation or warranty or any other
obligation or agreement of o2wireless under the Merger Agreement or (ii)
impede, interfere with, delay, postpone or attempt to discourage the Merger.
The Irrevocable Proxy terminates upon the termination of the Merger Agreement,
as more fully described in the Irrevocable Proxy. As of September&nbsp;3, 2002, the
shareholders and/or option holders of o2wireless that have entered into the
Irrevocable Proxy owned 13,348,353 shares of o2wireless Common Stock and
options to purchase 594,098 shares of o2wireless Common Stock (representing

subordinate in right of payment to the rights of Wachovia Bank, N.A. under an
amended and restated credit agreement between Wachovia Bank and o2wireless and

</FONT>
<P><FONT size="2">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In August 2002, as a result of a higher than anticipated operating loss at
o2wireless for the quarter ended June&nbsp;30, 2002, Baran and o2wireless agreed to
reduce the exchange ratio in the Merger Agreement, and Baran decided to delay
funding of further advances of working capital by Baran Acquisition to
o2wireless under the loan agreement. In addition, Wachovia Bank agreed to waive
the default by o2wireless at June&nbsp;30, 2002 in exchange for a principal
reduction payment of $1,000,000 and o2wireless&#146; agreement not to make any
payments to Baran without the consent of the bank.

<P align="left"><FONT size="2"><i>Management Consulting Agreement</i>
</FONT>

<P><FONT size="2">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;On June&nbsp;5, 2002, Baran and o2wireless entered into an agreement under
which Baran has begun providing financial and management consulting services to
o2wireless, on business and financial matters including corporate strategy,
budgeting of future corporate investments, acquisition and divestiture
decisions, operational matters and debt and equity financing. In consideration
for the services rendered by Baran under the agreement, o2wireless will pay
Baran a retainer of $400,000, and commencing in July 2002 and continuing each
month thereafter that the agreement is in effect, an amount equal to 6% of
o2wireless&#146; consolidated monthly revenues. While the agreement is in effect,
o2wireless will only be required to pay $40,000 of the monthly fees, with any
remaining fees to be paid when the consulting agreement terminates, or on the
date on which o2wireless&#146; and its subsidiaries&#146; obligations to Wachovia Bank,
under its credit agreement with Wachovia Bank, are paid in full.

by the Company on exemptions under the Securities Act is predicated in part
upon the truth and accuracy of the statements of the undersigned in this
Purchase Form.

with all information which it deems necessary to evaluate the merits and risks
of the purchase of the Warrant Stock, (2)&nbsp;it has had the opportunity to ask
questions concerning the Warrant Stock and the Company and all questions posed
have been answered to its satisfaction, (3)&nbsp;it has been given the opportunity

<P><FONT size="2">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The undersigned hereby represents and warrant that it is purchasing the
Warrant Stock for its own account for investment and not with a view to the
sale or distribution of all or any part of the Warrant Stock.
</FONT>
<P><FONT size="2">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The undersigned understands that because the Warrant Stock has not been
registered under the Securities Act, it must continue to bear the economic risk
of the investment for an indefinite period of time and the Warrant Stock cannot
be sold unless it is subsequently registered under applicable federal and state
securities laws or an exemption from such registration is available.
</FONT>
<P><FONT size="2">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The undersigned agrees that it will in no event sell or distribute or
otherwise dispose of all or any part of the Warrant Stock unless (1)&nbsp;there is
an effective registration statement under the Securities Act and applicable
state securities laws covering any such transaction involving the Warrant
Stock, or (2)&nbsp;the Company receives an opinion satisfactory to the Company of
the undersigned&#146;s legal counsel stating that such transaction is exempt from
registration. The undersigned consents to the placing of a legend on its
certificate for the Warrant Stock stating that the Warrant Stock has not been
registered and setting forth the restriction on transfer contemplated hereby
and to the placing of a stop transfer order on the books of the Company and
with any transfer agents against the Warrant Stock until the Warrant Stock may
be legally resold or distributed without restriction.

<P><FONT size="2">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The undersigned has considered the federal and state income tax
implications of the exercise of the Warrant and the purchase and subsequent
sale of the Warrant Stock.
