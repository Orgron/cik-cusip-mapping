           This statement amends Items 3, 5, 6 and 7 of the Amendment No. 7 to
the Schedule 13D of Wesmar Partners Limited Partnership, MR & Associates, Maurer
Ross & Co., Incorporated, Robert L. Ross and Richard M. Maurer (collectively the
"Reporting Persons") filed on November 9, 1999. All capitalized terms used
herein and not otherwise defined shall have the meanings ascribed to such terms
in the Amendment No.1 to the Schedule 13D of the Reporting Persons filed on
March 4, 1998 (the "Amendment No. 1 to the Schedule 13D").


Item 3.  Source and Amount of Funds and Other Consideration.

         On March 9, 2000, the Company's Board of Directors granted an
immediately exercisable option to purchase 10,000 shares of Common Stock to each
of Robert L. Ross ("Mr. Ross") and Richard M. Maurer ("Mr. Maurer") pursuant to
the 1998 Employee Stock Plan. Mr. Ross and Mr. Maurer are both directors and
executive officers of the Company.

Item 5.  Interest in Securities of Issuer.

         The number of shares of Common Stock issued and outstanding and the
percentage calculations resulting therefrom in this Item 5 are based on the
number of shares of Common Stock outstanding on March 13, 2000 as provided by
the Company in its Form 10-K filed on March 30, 2000.

         Wesmar is the record and beneficial owner of 1,399,096 shares of
Common Stock representing approximately 63.0% of the Common Stock outstanding.
Each of the other Reporting Persons may be deemed to beneficially own and to
share voting and dispositive power with Wesmar with respect to such 1,399,096
shares. Landmark Equity Partners III, L.P., a Delaware limited partnership and
the sole limited partner of Wesmar, has the right to receive dividends from, and
the proceeds from the sale of, a portion of the shares owned by Wesmar.

         Robert L. Ross, a director and executive officer of Maurer Ross &
Co., beneficially owns and has sole voting and dispositive power with respect to
7,000 shares of Common Stock, representing approximately 0.3% of the Common
Stock outstanding. Mr. Ross holds currently exercisable options to purchase
67,500 shares of Common Stock, and, therefore, is deemed to beneficially own
such shares. Assuming that the 67,500 shares of Common Stock issuable upon
exercise of Mr. Ross's options are currently issued and outstanding, Mr. Ross
beneficially owns approximately 3.0% of the Common Stock outstanding.

         Richard M. Maurer, a director and executive officer of Maurer Ross &
Co., indirectly beneficially owns and shares voting and dispositive power with
respect to 25,300 shares of Common Stock, representing approximately 1.4% of the
Common Stock outstanding. Such shares are held by three trusts of which Mr.
Maurer is a co-trustee. The other co-trustee (the "Co-Trustee") shares voting
and dispositive power with respect to, and has the right to direct receipt of
dividends from and the proceeds from the sale of, the 25,300 shares of Common
Stock held by the trusts. Information concerning the Co-Trustee is set forth on
Schedule I of the Amendment No. 1 to the Schedule 13D. Mr. Maurer also holds
currently exercisable options to


                                       7
<PAGE>   8

purchase 67,500 shares of Common Stock, and, therefore, is deemed to
beneficially own such shares. Assuming that the 67,500 shares of Common Stock
issuable upon exercise of Mr. Maurer's options are currently issued and
outstanding, Mr. Maurer beneficially owns approximately 3.4% of the Common Stock
outstanding.

         All transactions in Common Stock that were effected since the most
recent filing on Schedule 13D by any Reporting Person or by any person named in
Item 2 of the Amendment No. 1 to the Schedule 13D are described in Item 3.

Item 6.  Contracts, Arrangements, Understandings or Relationships with Respect
         to Securities of the Issuer.

         Wesmar and the Company are parties to a Stock Option Agreement dated as
of February 29, 1988 pursuant to which the Company has granted Wesmar certain
rights to require the Company to register shares of Common Stock owned by Wesmar
under the Securities Act of 1933, as amended, for public offering and sale. As
discussed in Items 3 and 5, each of Mr. Ross and Mr. Maurer holds a currently
exercisable option to purchase 10,000 shares of Common Stock at an exercise
price of $1.84375 per share, a currently exercisable option to purchase 50,000
shares of Common Stock at an exercise price of $3.0625 per share and a currently
exercisable option to purchase 7,500 shares of Common Stock at an exercise price
of $2.3125 per share.

Item 7.  Material to be filed as Exhibits.

A.       Agreement pursuant to Rule 13d-1(k).

B.       Stock Option Agreement, dated as of February 29, 1988, by and between
S2 Golf Inc. and Wesmar Partners (filed as Exhibit E to the Schedule 13D of
Wesmar Partners, First Westinghouse Capital Corporation and Maurer Ross & Co.,
Incorporated, dated February 25, 1988).
