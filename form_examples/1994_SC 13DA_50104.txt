         This Amendment No. 23 supplements and amends the Statement on Schedule
13D (the "Statement on Schedule 13D") filed with the Securities and Exchange
Commission on February 27, 1985, as it has been amended from time to time
thereafter, by Metropolitan Life Insurance Company ("Metropolitan") with
respect to the shares of common stock, par value $.16-2/3 per share (the
"Common Stock"), issued by Tesoro Petroleum Corporation (the "Issuer"), a
Delaware corporation.  Capitalized terms used herein without a definition have
the meanings ascribed to them in the Statement on Schedule 13D.

Item 4.  Purpose of Transaction.
Item 6.  Contracts, Arrangements, Understandings or
         Relationships With Respect to Securities of the Issuer.

         As previously disclosed, MetLife-Louisiana continues to give
consideration to the disposition of all or a portion of its holdings of the
Issuer's $2.20 Cumulative Convertible Preferred Stock ("Preferred Stock")
and/or Common Stock, with the objective of realizing on its investment in the
Issuer.  MetLife-Louisiana is currently the owner of 100% of the issued and
outstanding shares of the Preferred Stock (2,875,000 shares) and approximately
18% of the Common Stock (4,084,160 shares).  In separate meetings on February
14, 1994 and February 15, 1994, representatives of Metropolitan met on a
preliminary basis with two separate persons who expressed interest in
purchasing all or a portion of MetLife-Louisiana's holdings of the Issuer's
Preferred Stock and Common Stock.  No agreement was reached at either of such
meetings with respect to any such sale, but it is anticipated that further
discussions with such persons, and perhaps with others, will take place.  There
can be no assurance, however, that any such further discussions or any such
sale will occur.
