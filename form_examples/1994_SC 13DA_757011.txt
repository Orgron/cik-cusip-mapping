	This statement constitutes Amendment No. 5 
("Amendment No. 5") to the Statement on Schedule 13D, dated 
May 17, 1993, as amended by Amendment No. 1, dated 
January 10, 1994, Amendment No. 2, dated February 22, 1994, 
Amendment No. 3, dated March 14, 1994 and Amendment No. 4, 
dated March 17, 1994 (collectively, the "Schedule 13D"), 
filed by Water Street Corporate Recovery Fund I, L.P. 
("Water Street"), Goldman, Sachs & Co. ("Goldman Sachs") and 
The Goldman Sachs Group, L.P. ("GS Group" and together with 
Water Street and Goldman Sachs, the "Reporting Persons") in 
respect of the beneficial ownership by the Reporting Persons 
of shares of the common stock, par value $.10 per share (the 
"Common Stock"), of USG Corporation, a Delaware corporation 
(the "Company").  Capitalized terms used but otherwise not 
defined herein shall have the meaning ascribed to them in 
the Schedule 13D.

	Item 4 is hereby amended as follows:

	Item 4.	Purpose of the Transaction.

		On March 17, 1994, the underwriters in the 
Offering of Common Stock exercised in full their 
overallotment options to purchase an additional 900,000 
shares of Common Stock from the Company and 975,000 shares 
of Common Stock from Water Street, in each case, at the 
public offering price per share of $29.875.  The closing of 
that offering (the "Additional Offering") was consummated on 
March 22, 1994.

	Item 5 is hereby amended as follows:

	Item 5.	Interest in Securities of the Issuer.

		On March 22, 1994, the Additional Offering 
was consummated resulting in the sale of 900,000 shares of 
Common Stock by the Company and 975,000 shares of Common 
Stock by Water Street. Water Street received aggregate 
proceeds of approximately $28 million, net of the 
underwriting discount (but before payment of Water Street's 
other expenses), or $28.531 per share.

	As of the date hereof, Water Street 
beneficially owns 9,418,231 shares of Common Stock and 
Warrants to purchase 116,070 shares of Common Stock.  As of 
the date hereof, Goldman Sachs beneficially owns 96,539 
shares of Common Stock and, as the general partner of Water 
Street, may be deemed to be the beneficial owner of the 
9,418,231 shares of Common Stock and Warrants to purchase 
116,070 shares of Common Stock held by Water Street.  In 
addition, GS Group may be deemed to be the beneficial owner 
of (i) the 9,418,231 shares of Common Stock and Warrants to 
purchase 116,070 shares of Common Stock held by Water Street 
and (ii) the 96,539 shares of Common Stock held by Goldman 
Sachs.  Accordingly, Water Street, Goldman Sachs and GS 
Group beneficially own (without giving effect to the 
Warrants owned by Water Street) 21% of the outstanding 
shares of Common Stock.  Assuming that Water 
<PAGE>
Street exercises all of its Warrants, but that no other Warrants 
are exercised, Water Street, Goldman Sachs and GS Group 
would beneficially own 21% of the outstanding shares of 
Common Stock.
