Mitsui-Japan, Intermodal and Tonami, respectively, are hereby amended and
restated by Appendices A, B and C which are attached hereto and incorporated
herein by reference.

Item 4.  Purpose of Transaction.
         Item 4 remains unchanged except for the following:
         On March 17 1994, Mitsui-Japan and Tonami gave notice of conversion
with respect to the 620,000 and 60,000 of the Preferred Shares owned by them,
respectively, and sold the aggregate 1,453,427 Common Shares issuable upon such
conversion to Goldman Sachs & Co. The sale will be settled on March 24, 1994.

         Except as set forth above, none of the Reporting Persons has any plans
or proposals which relate to or would result in any of the consequences set
forth in clauses (a) through (j) of Item 4 of Schedule 13D.

Item 5.  Interest in Securities of the Issuer. 
         Paragraphs (a) and (b) are amended and restated in their entirety as 
follows:      

         (a)  Under Rule 13d-3 under the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as
amended (the "Exchange Act"), Mitsui-Japan is the beneficial owner of the
120,000 Preferred Shares owned by its subsidiary, Intermodal.  Subject to the
limitation described in the following paragraph, each Preferred Share is
convertible into a number of Common Shares equal to the quotient of the stated
value

of a Preferred Share ($50) divided by the conversion price in effect at the
time of conversion (currently $23.393, subject to anti-dilution adjustment) as
set forth in Section 6(c) of the Certificate of Designation of Preferences of
Preferred Shares (the "Certificate") filed with the Secretary of State of
Delaware on January 26, 1990 and incorporated herein by reference to Exhibit F
to the Original Statement.  Under Rule 13d-3 under the Exchange Act,
Mitsui-Japan is the beneficial owner of 3,000 Common Shares issuable upon the
exercise of stock options granted by Airborne to Messrs. Hiroshi Ohara and
Motohiko Kogetsu (the "Grantees").  The Grantees may not exercise such options
without the consent of Mitsui-Japan and have agreed to transfer the Common
Shares underlying the options to Mitsui-Japan if it provides the exercise price
therefor or otherwise to transfer any proceeds from the sale of such Common
Shares to Mitsui-Japan.  Options with respect to 1,000 Common Shares expire on
February 2, 2001; options with respect to 1,000 Common Shares expire on
February 2, 2002 and options with respect to 1,000 Common Shares expire on
February 2, 2003.
         Subject to the limitation described in the following paragraph, the
120,000 Preferred Shares beneficially owned by Mitsui- Japan are thus
convertible into 256,487 Common Shares, which, together with the 3,000 Common
Shares issuable upon the conversion of the stock

options, represent approximately 1.3% of the sum of the 19,256,251 Common
Shares that the Reporting Persons understand from Airborne's Quarterly Report
on Form 10-Q dated November 11, 1993 were outstanding on September 30, 1993
plus the 259,487 Common Shares issuable upon conversion of such Preferred
Shares and Stock Options.
         Section 6(a)(i) of the Certificate (which is incorporated herein by
reference) provides that a holder may convert into Common Shares only such
number of Preferred Shares as will not cause the ownership of Airborne's voting
securities by persons who are not "United States Citizens" (as defined in the
Aviation Act) to exceed that percentage then permitted by the Aviation Act in
order to hold certificates authorizing Airborne or its subsidiaries to engage
in air transportation less 5%.  Under current law, this provision effectively
limits the ability of the Reporting Persons (or any subsequent foreign holders
or foreign-controlled holders of Preferred Shares) to convert Preferred Shares
into Common Shares if such conversion would increase the foreign ownership of
Airborne's voting securities (currently, its Common Shares) beyond the 20% (25%
- - 5%) level.  The Reporting Persons are not aware of any foreign ownership of
Airborne's voting securities which would result in the limitation imposed by
Section 6(a)(i) of

the Certificate restricting any Reporting Person from converting all of its
Preferred Share holdings.
         Intermodal beneficially owns 120,000 Preferred Shares, which are
convertible as described above, into 256,487 Common Shares, representing
approximately 1.3% of the sum of the 19,256,251 outstanding Common Shares plus
the 256,487 Common Shares issuable upon such conversion.
         Tonami no longer beneficially owns any Preferred Shares.
         Intermodal disclaims beneficial ownership of the 3,000 Common Shares
(issuable upon the conversion of stock options) beneficially owned by
Mitsui-Japan.  Tonami disclaims beneficial ownership of the

3,000 Common Shares (issuable upon the conversion of stock options) 
beneficially owned by Mitsui-Japan.
         (b)  Mitsui-Japan and Intermodal share the power to vote or direct 
the vote and to dispose or direct the disposition of the 120,000 Preferred 
Shares (and the 256,487 Common Shares issuable upon conversion thereof) owned 
by Intermodal directly (and Mitsui-Japan indirectly).  Mitsui-Japan and Mr. 
Ohara share the power to vote or direct the vote or to dispose or direct the 
disposition of the 1,000 Common Shares owned by Mr. Ohara directly (and 
Mitsui-Japan beneficially).  Mitsui-Japan and Mr. Kogetsu share the power to 
vote or direct the vote or to dispose or direct the disposition of the 2,000 
Common Shares owned by Mr. Kogetsu directly (and Mitsui-Japan beneficially).  
         (c)  On March 17, 1994, Mitsui-Japan gave notice of conversion of the
620,000 Preferred Shares owned by it directly and sold the 1,325,183 Common
Shares issuable upon conversion of such Preferred Shares to Goldman, Sachs &
Co. ("Goldman") at a purchase price of $36.125 per share in a trade effected
over the New York Stock Exchange (the "NYSE") to be settled on March 24, 1994. 
On March 17, 1994, Tonami gave notice of conversion of the 60,000 Preferred
Shares owned by it directly and sold the 128,244 Common Shares issuable upon
conversion of such shares to Goldman at a purchase price of $36.125 per shares
in a trade effected over the NYSE to be  settled on March 24, 1994. 
         (d)  Not applicable.
         (e)  The Reporting Persons ceased to be the beneficial owners of more
than five percent of the Common Shares of ABF on March 17, 1994.
