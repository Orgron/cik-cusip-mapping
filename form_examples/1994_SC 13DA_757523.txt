          Officer  of  The  ARA  Group,  Inc.,  The ARA Tower, 1101  Market

               D.   During the last five years, Mr.  Neubauer  has not been

          party to a civil proceeding of a judicial or administrative  body
          of   competent  jurisdiction  that  resulted  in  subjecting  Mr.
          Neubauer  to  a judgement, decree or final order enjoining future
          violations of, or prohibiting or mandating activities subject to,
          federal or state  securities  laws  or finding any violation with
          respect to such laws.

               F.   Mr.  Neubauer  is a citizen of  the  United  States  of
          America.

          Item 3.   Source and Amount of Funds or Other Consideration.

               In order to exercise  stock  options  and  installment stock
          purchase opportunities to acquire an aggregate of  78,068  shares
          in  April,  1993 and December, 1993, for an aggregate of $387,186
          including  $171,930   to  pay  required  withholding  taxes,  Mr.

          Item 5.   Interest in Securities of the Issuer.

               A.   The   aggregate  number  of  shares  of  Common   Stock
          beneficially owned  by  Mr.  Neubauer  as of December 31, 1993 is
          4,935,312 shares (including 26,756 shares  which Mr. Neubauer has
          or  within  the next sixty days will have the  current  right  to
          acquire from ARA pursuant to the exercise of outstanding employee
          stock options).   The  percentage  of  the  class of Common Stock
          owned by Mr. Neubauer is approximately 20%.

               Mr.  Neubauer  is  a  participant  in  the  ARA  Stock  Unit
          Retirement  Plan.   Mr.  Neubauer had been an active  participant
          until September 30, 1989 in  the  ARA  Services,  Inc. Retirement
          Savings Plan for Salaried Employees.  He still has  an account in
          such  Plan  and is a beneficiary of the Plan's Trust which  holds
          shares of ARA  Common  Stock Class A.  However, he currently does
          not make contributions to  the  Plan,  and ARA currently does not
          make contributions on his behalf.

               This statement shall not be deemed  an  admission  that  Mr.
          Neubauer  is,  for  purposes  of  Section 13(d) or otherwise, the
          beneficial owner of any of the equity  securities covered by this
          statement.

               B.   Mr. Neubauer has sole power to  vote  and sole power to
          dispose or direct the disposition of 4,862,532 shares  (including
          26,756  shares  which  Mr. Neubauer has or within the next  sixty
          days will have the current  right to acquire from ARA pursuant to
          the  exercise  of  outstanding  employee   stock  options).   Mr.
          Neubauer shares voting and investment powers  as to 72,780 shares
          with two co-trustees of The Neubauer Family Foundation.   The two
          co-trustees are Mr. Neubauer's son, Lawrence A. Neubauer, and Mr.
          Neubauer's daughter, Melissa R. Neubauer.  Their address is:  c/o
          Joseph  Neubauer,  The ARA Tower, 1101 Market Street, Suite 3100,
          Philadelphia,  PA  19107.   They  both  are  presently  students.
          During the last  five  years,  neither  has  been  convicted in a
          criminal  proceeding  (excluding  traffic violations and  similar
          misdemeanors).  During the past five  years,  neither  has been a
          party to a civil proceeding of a judicial or administrative  body
          of  competent  jurisdiction that resulted in subjecting either of
          them to a judgement,  decree  or  final  order  enjoining  future
          violations of, or prohibiting or mandating activities subject to,
          federal  or  state  securities laws or finding any violation with
          respect to such laws.   Both are citizens of the United States of
          America.

               C.   Mr. Neubauer acquired  from  ARA  on  December 20, 1993
          26,752 shares of Common Stock at an exercise price  per  share of
          $1.91  (plus  $3.53  per  share  in required withholding); 16,048
          shares of Common Stock at an exercise  price  per  share of $7.47
          (plus $1.42 per share in required withholding); and 10,272 shares
          of  Common  Stock  at an exercise price per share of $5.25  (plus
          $2.19 per share in required  withholding);  all  pursuant  to the
          exercise  of  outstanding  stock  options  and  installment stock
          purchase opportunities.

               Mr.  Neubauer transferred 30,000 shares to Tufts  University
          on December  22, 1993 as a gift.  Mr. Neubauer transferred 72,780
          shares to The  Neubauer Family Foundation, a 501(c)(3) charitable
          organization, on  December  23, 1993, as a gift.  Mr. Neubauer is
          one of the trustees of the trust and shares voting and investment
          power for the shares.

                                Page 4 of 5 Pages
<PAGE>
               Mr. Neubauer no longer reports  other  shares  held in trust
          for  his  adult  children,  as  to  which shares he continues  to
          disclaim beneficial ownership.

               D.   Under certain circumstances,  a  person  other than Mr.
          Neubauer has the right to receive the proceeds from  the  sale of
          certain of the shares of Common Stock reported on this statement.
          Such interest relates to shares representing less than 1% of  the
          outstanding Common stock.

               No other person is known to have the right to receive or the
          power  to  direct receipt of dividends from, or the proceeds from
          the sale of the Common Stock.

               E.    Not applicable.

          Item 6.   Contract  Arrangements, Understandings or Relationships
                    With Respect to the Securities of the Issuer.

               In connection with  Mr.  Neubauer's participation in the ARA
          Deferred Payment Program, Mr. Neubauer has pledged 662,372 shares
          of  Common  Stock  to  ARA.  In connection  with  Mr.  Neubauer's
          borrowings from the bank  referred  to  in the response to Item 3
          and  previous  borrowings (which were disclosed  with  prior  13D
          filings), Mr. Neubauer has pledged 971,800 shares of Common Stock
          to one bank and  734,416  shares of Common Stock to another bank.
          In connection with other borrowings,  Mr.  Neubauer  has  pledged
          205,740 shares to another financial institution.

          Item 7.   Material to be filed as Exhibits.

               The   description   of  the  ARA  Deferred  Payment  Program
          contained in the ARA Ownership Program Prospectuses dated  May 5,
          1993  and  November  22,  1993  (File  Nos.  33-44002,  33-30879,
          33-33329  and  33-11818) is incorporated  herein   by  reference.
          The  promissory  notes   and  loan  agreements  relating  to  Mr.
