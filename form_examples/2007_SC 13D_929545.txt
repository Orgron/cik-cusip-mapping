<PAGE>


ITEM 1. SECURITY AND ISSUER

         This statement on Schedule 13D ("Statement") relates to the common
stock, no par value ("Common Stock"), of Supertel Hospitality, Inc., a Nebraska
corporation (the "Issuer"). The principal executive offices of the Issuer are
located at 309 N. 5th Street, Norfolk, Nebraska 68701.

ITEM 2. IDENTITY AND BACKGROUND

         (a) - (c) AND (f). This Statement is filed by Clarus Capital Group
Management LP, a Delaware limited partnership ("Clarus") and Ephraim Fields
(together, the "Reporting Persons").

         Clarus is a private investment management firm which invests in
publicly traded U.S. equity securities. The general partner to Clarus Capital
Group Management LP is Clarus Capital Management, LLC. Ephraim Fields is the
managing member of Clarus Capital Management, LLC and as such controls Clarus
Capital Group Management LP. Mr. Fields is engaged principally in the business
of serving as the sole managing member of Clarus and an affiliate, Clarus
Capital Advisors, LLC. Mr. Fields is a citizen of the United States of America.

         The principal business address of each of the Reporting Persons is 237
Park Ave., Suite 900, New York, NY 10017.

         (d) - (e). None of the Reporting Persons during the last five years has
been convicted in a criminal proceeding (excluding traffic violations and
similar misdemeanors) or was party to a civil proceeding of a judicial or
administrative body of competent jurisdiction as a result of which any such
person was or is subject to a judgment, decree or final order enjoining future
violations of, or prohibiting or mandating activities subject to, federal or
state securities laws or finding any violation with respect to such laws.

ITEM 3. SOURCE AND AMOUNT OF FUNDS OR OTHER CONSIDERATION

         The aggregate purchase price of the 1,051,848 shares of Common Stock
owned by the Reporting Persons is approximately $6,400,782 including brokerage
commissions. The shares of Common Stock owned by the Reporting Persons were
acquired with the working capital of Clarus.

ITEM 4. PURPOSE OF TRANSACTION

         The Reporting Persons purchased the shares of Common Stock based on the
Reporting Persons' belief that the shares of Common Stock are undervalued and
represented an attractive investment opportunity. Clarus reserves the right,
consistent with applicable law, to acquire or dispose of additional securities
of the Issuer (whether through open market purchases, block trades, private
acquisitions, tender or exchange offers or otherwise). Clarus intends to review
its investment in the Issuer on a continuing basis and may engage in discussions
with management or the Board of Directors of the Issuer concerning the business,
operations and future plans of the Issuer. Depending on various factors,
including, without limitation, the Issuer's financial position and investment
strategy, the price levels of the Common Stock, conditions in the securities
markets and general economic and industry conditions, Clarus may in the future
take such actions with respect to its investment in the Issuer as it deems


<PAGE>


appropriate including, without limitation, seeking Board representation, making
proposals to the Issuer concerning the capitalization and operations of the
Issuer, engaging in short selling of or any hedging or similar transaction with
respect to the Common Stock, or changing its intention partially or entirely
with respect to any and all matters referred to in Item 4.


         On November 19, 2007, Clarus sent a letter to the Board of Directors of
the Issuer which set forth Clarus' belief that the Issuer's Common Stock is
undervalued and demanded that the Board of Directors hire a prominent investment
bank to explore strategic alternatives for enhancing shareholder value,
including the outright sale of the company. Clarus noted that while it is
supportive of the company's acquisition strategy, Clarus is concerned that the
Issuer's senior management (including its 73 year old CEO and 62 year old CFO)
are distracted by personal, health and other issues which are preventing them
from acting in the best interests of shareholders. Clarus believes that because
of the Issuer's tiny market capitalization, the Issuer will have difficulty
achieving an appropriate valuation in the public market and that shareholders
would be best served through the sale of the company.  Clarus believes a more
sophisticated and motivated management team could create significant
shareholder value from the Issuer's assets by (1) expanding the highly
accretive acquisition program; (2) monetizing the Issuer's extensive real
estate holdings, much of which is worth significantly more than its current
book value; (3) reducing or eliminating the Issuer's relatively high public
company costs; and (4) lowering the Issuer's overall cost of capital.


ITEM 5. INTEREST IN SECURITIES OF THE ISSUER.

         The percentages set forth in this Item 5 are based on the Form 10-Q
filed by the Issuer on November 9, 2007, which stated that as of October 31,
2007, there were 20,563,426 shares of Common Stock outstanding.

         (a) As of the close of business on November 16, 2007, the Reporting
Persons directly own 1,051,848 shares of Common Stock representing approximately
5.1% of the outstanding Common Stock. As of November 16, 2007, the date
requiring the filing of this Schedule 13D, the Reporting Persons directly owned
1,051,848 shares of Common Stock representing approximately 5.1% of the
outstanding Common Stock.

         (b) The Reporting Persons have the sole power to vote and dispose of
1,051,848 shares of Common Stock and shared power to vote and dispose of
1,051,848 of Common Stock. Mr. Fields is the sole managing principal and
indirectly the 100% owner of Clarus.

         (c) See Appendix A for a list of transactions occurring in the last
sixty days.

         (d) Not applicable.

         (e) Not applicable.

ITEM 6. CONTRACTS, ARRANGEMENTS, UNDERSTANDINGS OR RELATIONSHIPS WITH RESPECT TO
SECURITIES OF THE ISSUER.

         Other than as described in Item 4 herein, there are no contracts,
arrangements, understandings or relationships among the Reporting Persons, or
between the Reporting Persons and any other person, with respect to the
securities of the Issuer.

<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 6pt">Clarus Capital Group Management LP beneficially owns approximately 5.1% of the
outstanding common shares of Supertel Hospitality, Inc. (&#147;SPPR&#148; or the
&#147;Company&#148;) and we believe we are the Company&#146;s second largest shareholder. We
have been investors in the Company for over two years and have been patiently
supportive of management&#146;s acquisition strategy. While we continue to believe
this strategy is sound, we have grave concerns about the ability of the current
management team to execute this strategy. The business of indentifying,
financing and integrating acquisitions is complicated and time consuming and we
are concerned that SPPR&#146;s senior management (including its 73&nbsp;year old CEO and
its 62&nbsp;year old CFO) are distracted by personal, health and other issues which
are preventing them from fully acting in the best interest of all shareholders.
Furthermore, we question why SPPR remains publicly traded. SPPR is one of the
smallest publicly traded REITS (and thus incurs disproportionately high public
company costs) and management makes very little effort to communicate with the
investment community (management does not conduct earnings conference calls and
it rarely attends investor conferences or meets with investors).

2008E FFO, pays an 8% dividend, has a healthy balance sheet and significantly
undervalued real estate. In the past, we have suggested to you (in private
communications) that because of its tiny market capitalization SPPR would have
difficulty achieving an appropriate valuation in the public market and that
shareholders would be best served through a sale of the company. Since you have
elected not to accept our advice (and your stock price has continued to decline), <u>we are now publicly demanding that you hire a
