     Item 1.   Security and Issuer
               -------------------

     Item 2.  Identity and Background
              -----------------------
               (a) - (c), (f)  This Statement is being filed by Citicorp
     ("Citicorp"), a Delaware corporation and Citibank, N.A. ("Citibank"),
     a national banking association organized under the National Bank Act
     of the United States of America.  Citicorp is a multi-bank holding

               The names, business addresses, principal occupations and
     citizenship of the executive officers, directors and controlling
     persons of Citicorp and Citibank are set forth on Schedule A attached
     hereto.

               (d), (e)  During the last five years, none of Citicorp,

     tions of, or prohibiting or mandating activities subject to, federal
     or state securities laws or finding any violation with respect to such
     laws.

     Item 3. Source and Amount of Funds or Other Consideration.
             -------------------------------------------------
               Pursuant to the terms of an Amended and Restated Amendment,
     dated as of March 18, 1992 (the "Amendment"), amending an Amendment,
     dated as of July 31, 1991 to an Amended and Restated Loan Agreement,
     dated as of October 26, 1987 (as amended by letter amendments dated
     October 26, 1988, October 26, 1989 and April 26, 1990 and a
     Consolidation and Amendment to an Amended and Restated Loan Agreement
     dated August 8, 1990) by and between The Trump-Alexander's Company, a
     New York general partnership ("Trump-Alexander's") and Citibank, as
     agreed to by Donald J. Trump, Trump-Alexander's delivered to Citibank
     a promissory note
























           
     NYFS11...:\88\35888\0410\2396\NOT31094.V3A

<PAGE>
     

     in principal amount of $71,205,000 (which included $2,500,000 of
     capitalized interest as of August 8, 1990) plus accrued and unpaid
     interest to the date of the transfer of the Shares referred to below
     (the "Note").  The Note provided that, upon demand by Citibank for
     payment or on June 30, 1995, Trump-Alexander's would transfer to
     Citibank, good and valid title to 1,353,468 shares of Common Stock of
     the Issuer (together with any and all distributions thereon or
     securities or other property in exchange therefor, in either case
     receivable after March 18, 1992) (the "Shares"), in exchange for
     Citibank's agreement to forbear, except upon the occurrence of a
     Forbearance Termination Date (as defined in the Guarantor Agreement
     and Consent entered into by Citibank and Donald J. Trump) from seeking
     any deficiency against Donald J. Trump personally.  On April 16, 1992,
     Trump-Alexander's transferred the Shares to Citibank pursuant to
     Citibank's previous demand.

     Item 4.  Purpose of Transaction
              ----------------------
               The Amendment was entered into as a result of a
     restructuring of finances by Donald J. Trump.  The purpose of the
     transaction was to maximize Citibank's recovery on its loan to Trump-
     Alexander's.

               (a)   Citibank continues to analyze the various financial
     alternatives that may be available to it with respect to realizing on
     the Shares.  Citibank may sell all or from time to time any part of
     the Shares in the open market and/or privately negotiated
     transactions.  Citibank is also considering providing financing to the
     Issuer to fund the Issuer's plan of reorganization and ongoing working
     capital needs, which financing would be on a secured basis.

               (b)-(j) Neither Citibank nor Citicorp has any present plans
     or intentions which would result in or relate to any of the
     transactions described in subparagraphs (b) through (j) of Item 4 of
     Schedule 13D.  Citibank reserves the right to participate in
     discussion looking toward an extraordinary corporate transaction by
     the Issuer with a third party, such as a merger, joint venture or sale
     of assets.  On April 16, 1992, Peter T. Baumann, a Vice President of
     Citibank, Wendy Silverstein, a Vice President of Citibank, and
     Patricia Goldstein, a Vice President of Citibank, were elected as
     directors of the Issuer.

     Item 5.   Interest in Securities of the Issuer
               ------------------------------------
               (a)   The Shares represent 27.1% of the Issuer's issued and
     outstanding shares of Common Stock, based on 5,000,850 issued

     and outstanding shares (as indicated in the Issuer's 10-Q dated
     November 24, 1993).  Citicorp, by virtue of its direct ownership of
     all of the outstanding capital stock of Citibank may be deemed, for
     purposes of Rule 13d-3 of the Act, to beneficially own the Shares.

               (b)  Citibank has the sole power to vote or to direct the
     voting of, and the sole power to dispose of or to direct the
     disposition of the Shares.  Citicorp by virtue of its direct ownership
     of all of the outstanding capital stock of Citibank may be deemed for
     purposes of Rule 13d-3 of the Act, to beneficially own the Shares.

               (c)  Not applicable.

               (d)  Not applicable.

               (e)  Not applicable.
