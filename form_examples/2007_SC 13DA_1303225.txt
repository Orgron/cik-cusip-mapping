VIA E-MAIL

Halo Technology Holdings, Inc. (the "Company")
151 Railroad Avenue
Greenwich, CT 06890
Attn:  Mr. Rodney A. Bienvenu, Jr.

Dear Ron:

      As we discussed with you in our recent meeting, we are continuing to
carefully monitor Crestview Capital Master LLC's (the "Fund") investment in the
Company. This letter is to inform you that the Fund, together with certain
designees to be determined by us, would be interested in acquiring the business
of the Company's wholly owned subsidiary, Empagio, Inc. ("Empagio"), as further
described below (the "Transaction"). We are willing to pay aggregate
consideration of $18 million for the Empagio business on a cash free, debt free
basis, together with an appropriate working capital adjustment (to be mutually
agreed to by the parties), and assuming our comfort with Empagio's liabilities,
obligations, deferred revenue and overall financial position (all to be
confirmed by us during our limited confirmatory due diligence period described
below). We would pay such consideration in a combination of $11 million in cash,
$2 million in assumption by Empagio of the Company's outstanding note currently
held by the Fund, and an issuance of a promissory note for $5 million in
cash over a three (3) to five (5) year period. Of course, such promissory note
to the Company would be subordinate to, and the terms thereof would be subject
to agreement by, senior financing sources who we would seek to provide our debt
financing. Subject to obtaining any necessary consents and approvals outside of
our control, negotiation of mutually acceptable definitive transaction
documents, and an acceptable fairness/valuation opinion (from a reputable
financial advisory firm acceptable to us), we would envision signing such
Transaction documents by April 30, 2007 and closing the Transaction within six
(6) weeks from the date hereof, all of which will give us time to complete our
confirmatory due diligence. Based on our current understanding of the business
of Empagio, we believe that we can secure the appropriate financing for this
acquisition during that period. Accordingly, we are prepared to begin working
with the Company immediately, and to devote substantially time, effort and
resources in an effort to accomplish the Transaction, all on the following terms
and conditions:

1.    The Company agrees that from the date hereof until 9:00 P.M., Chicago
      time, on April 30, 2007 (the "Exclusivity Period") neither the Company,
      Empagio, nor any subsidiary shall, directly or indirectly, nor any
      affiliate, subsidiary, stockholder, officer, director, employee, agent or
      representative of any of them, will (i) solicit, initiate or encourage
      discussions with, or the submission of bids, offers or proposals by, any
      person or entity with respect to the acquisition, issuance or sale of any
      debt, equity securities or other financial instruments of, or any assets
      of, or relating to, Empagio and/or any direct or indirect subsidiary
      thereof or any of their businesses, (ii) engage in discussions or
      negotiations concerning any such transaction or matter with, or provide
      any information with a view toward any such transaction or matter to, any
      person or entity other than us or the Fund, (iii) accept any offer or
      proposal for, or enter into any agreement relating to, any such
      transaction or matter or in any other way competitive with the Transaction
      or (iv) take any other action which is inconsistent with or adverse to the

<PAGE>

      consummation of an acquisition of the business of Empagio by the Fund and
      its designees (any of the foregoing in clauses (i)-(iv) being an
      "Alternative Transaction"). During the Exclusivity Period, the Company
      shall immediately advise the Fund orally (and promptly thereafter in
      writing) of any inquiry or proposal by any party other than the Fund with
      respect to, or related to, Empagio, its securities or assets, or relating
      to an Alternative Transaction or any request for information in connection
      with an Alternative Transaction and the material terms and conditions of
      such inquiry, proposal or request. In addition, the Company and Empagio
      shall promptly submit to the Fund copies of all written materials it may
      receive with respect to any such Alternative Transaction. In the unlikely
      event that contrary to the parties expectations a Transaction agreement
      would not be executed by the end of the Exclusivity Period and the Fund is
      still proceeding in good faith with respect to a potential Transaction,
      such Exclusivity Period shall automatically be extended for an additional
      one week period. If the Company or Empagio enters into an agreement within
      six (6) months following the termination of the Exclusivity Period
      providing for an Alternative Transaction, or shall breach the terms of
      this Section 1, then, without limiting the Fund's right to seek damages or
      injunctive relief, the Company shall immediately pay by wire transfer of
      immediately available funds to such accounts as the Fund may designate,
      the sum of $900,000.

2.    The Company shall reimburse us and the Fund for (or pay at the Fund's
      direction) all legal, transactional and due diligence costs associated
      with our and the Fund's efforts with respect to a Transaction. Such amount
      shall be payable upon request.

3.    In connection with the possible Transaction, the Fund and its
      representatives shall be given reasonable access to, and information with
      respect to, the books and records of the Company and Empagio for the
      purpose of completing its diligence review of Empagio and its business.
      All information obtained by the parties and their respective
      representatives during the course of such review will be maintained by the
      parties and their representatives on a confidential basis in accordance
      with the terms of a to be executed confidentiality agreement, which the
      parties shall promptly negotiate and execute on a mutually acceptable
      basis following execution of this letter.

  While the parties desire to accomplish a Transaction, and have so indicated by
  signing below, the parties also agree and acknowledge, by signing below, that
  this letter simply constitutes an expression of such desire and that none of
  the parties shall be legally obligated to enter into a Transaction.
  Accordingly, unless definitive written agreements mutually acceptable to the
  parties providing for a Transaction are entered into (regardless of the reason
  for such agreements not so having been entered into), none of the parties
  hereto shall be under any obligation to the other irrespective of any
  negotiations, agreements or undertakings between, or actions taken by, such
  parties except as contemplated by paragraphs 1 and 2 above. This letter
  agreement constitutes the entire agreement of the parties hereto with respect
  to the subject matter hereof and supersedes all other (if any) prior
  agreements and undertakings, both written and oral, between or among the
  parties with respect to the subject matter hereof. This letter agreement may
  be executed and delivered (including by facsimile or portable document format
  (pdf) transmission) in one or more counterparts, and by the different parties
  hereto in separate counterparts, each of which when executed shall be deemed
  to be an original, but all of which taken together shall constitute one and
  the same agreement. This letter agreement shall be

                                       2


<PAGE>



      governed by, and construed in accordance with, the laws of the State of
      Illinois applicable to contracts executed in and to be performed in that
      State, except that matters which are solely defined by Chapter 78 of the
      Nevada Revised Statutes shall be governed thereby. The parties hereby
      consent to venue and jurisdiction in the courts of the State of Illinois.
      Should we or the Fund be required to enforce this agreement, each of us
      and the Fund shall be entitled to our attorneys' fees and other costs of
      enforcement. The Company agrees that the Fund shall be an express third

Dear Ron:

      This is a follow-up to our letter delivered Friday, April 6, 2007 (the
"Proposal Letter") expressing the desire of Crestview Capital Master LLC (the
"Fund"), together with certain designees to be determined by us, to acquire the
business of the Company's wholly owned subsidiary, Empagio, Inc. ("Empagio"). We
have yet to receive a formal reply from the Company and believe that you are
unwilling to execute our Proposal Letter as submitted. Nonetheless, given our
continuing interest in an Empagio transaction we are willing to proceed on the
basis of the following revisions to our Proposal Letter:


      We are willing to pay aggregate consideration of $18 million for the
      Empagio business in a combination of $11 million in cash, $2 million in
      assumption by Empagio of the Company's outstanding note
      currently held by the Fund, and an issuance of a promissory note for $5
      million in cash over a three (3) to five (5) year period, all as more
      fully described in the attached revised proposal letter.

      Notwithstanding that more than a week has passed since we submitted our
Proposal Letter, we are still willing to devote substantial time, effort and
resources to work to accomplish both a signing of the proposed transaction by
April 30, 2007 and a closing shortly thereafter. In this regard, we can assure
you that with access to appropriate financial information to enable us to
undertake our confirmatory due diligence, we would be committed to moving as
quickly as possible with respect to a potential transaction. In particular, we
believe that with access to appropriate financial information we would quickly
be able to confirm the purchase price referenced above. And, given our current
investment position in the Company, our knowledge as to the Company's business,
and the assistance we are receiving from a respected industry leader in
connection with our investment in the Company, and in particular the Empagio
opportunity, we would be surprised if anyone else could bring as much certainty
of closure to the Company in finalizing due diligence and negotiating and
closing an acquisition of the business of Empagio.

<PAGE>

         As a current significant common stockholder and note holder, we believe
that our modified proposal is quite favorable to the Company -- both in terms of
aggregate consideration to be paid and immediate cash payment to help the
Company address what is clearly a difficult liquidity situation -- and we fully
expect the Company, its Board of Directors and its officers to live up to all
applicable duties to us and to all other stakeholders to fully explore the
proposed transaction with us.

         In order to expedite work on our proposed transaction, we have included
a revised version of our Proposal Letter, modified to encompass the matters set
forth above, for your execution and return to us, no later than the 12:00 p.m.
Chicago time, Sunday, April 15, 2007.

         We look forward to hearing from you shortly.


                                            Sincerely,

                                            CRESTVIEW CAPITAL PARTNERS, LLC
