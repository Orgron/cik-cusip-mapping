Item 1.  Security and Issuer.

This statement on Schedule 13D (this "Schedule 13D") relates to the common
stock (the "Shares") of WESTERN ASSET VARIABLE RATE STRATEGIC FUND, INC.
(the "Issuer").

The address of the principal executive offices of the Issuer is:  620 Eighth
Avenue, 49th Floor, New York, New York 10018.
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Item 2.  Identity and Background.

(a),(f) This Schedule D is being filed on behalf of Relative Value Partners
Group, LLC, a limited liability company organized under the laws of the State
of Delaware (the "Reporting Person").

(b) The principal business address for the Reporting Person is 1033 Skokie
Blvd, Suite 470, Northbrook, IL 60062.

(c) The Reporting Person is a registered investment adviser with the United
States Securities and Exchange Commission.

(d) The Reporting Person has not been convicted of a criminal proceeding
during the last five years.

(e) The Reporting has not, during the last five years, been party to a civil
proceeding of a judicial or administrative body of competent jurisdiction as a
result of which the Reporting Person is or was subject to a judgment, decree,
or final order enjoining future violations of, or prohibiting or mandating
activities subject to, federal or state securities laws on finding any
violation with respect to such laws.
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Item 3.  Source or Amount of Funds or Other Consideration.

Source or Amount of Funds or Other Consideration. The Reporting Person is not
acquiring additional Shares that trigger the filing of this Schedule 13D. All
of the Shares acquired by the Reporting Person were done on behalf of its
advisory clients whose assets it manages on a discretionary basis. This
Schedule 13D filing was triggered, not by an acquisition of Shares, but a
change of intent from investment purposes only to one with an intent to
influence and/or control the Issuer. Any future acquisitions of Shares of
the Issuer that occur after the filing of this Schedule 13D will be made on
behalf of the advisory clients whom the Reporting Person serves. All funds
will be client funds, including advisory client funds that are funds of the
principals of the Reporting Person. Individual advisory client accounts may
be levered, but the Reporting Person as a whole has not borrowed or
leveraged any assets to facilitate past purchases of the Issuer, nor will
it do so for any purchases in the future.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Item 4.  Purpose of Transaction.

Purpose of Transaction. The Adviser is filing this Schedule 13D to reflect a
change in intent of holding the Shares from investment purposes only to one
with an intent to influence and/or control the Issuer.

The Adviser has previously filed a Schedule 13D in May 2015 when it similarly
changed its purpose from investment purpose only to one of control or
influence.  The Adviser subsequently returned to investment purposes only and
has filed multiple Schedule 13Gs that reflect that purpose change as well as
any of its clients ownership changes.

The Reporting Person may engage in discussions with management, the Board of
Directors, other shareholders of the Issuer and other relevant parties,
including representatives of any of the foregoing, concerning the Reporting
Person's investment in the Shares and the Issuer, including, without
limitation, matters concerning the Issuer's business, operations, governance,
management, capitalization and strategic plans. The Reporting Person may
exchange information with any persons pursuant to appropriate confidentiality
or similar agreements or otherwise, work together with any persons pursuant
to joint agreements or otherwise, propose changes in the Issuer's business,
operations, governance, management, capitalization or strategic plans, or
propose or engage in one or more other actions set forth under subparagraphs
(a)-(j) of Item 4 of Schedule 13D.

The Reporting Person intends to review its investment in the Issuer on a
continuing basis. Depending on various factors, including, without limitation,
the outcome of any discussions referenced above, the Issuer's financial
position and strategic direction, actions taken by management or the Board of
Directors, price levels of the Shares, other investment opportunities
available to the Reporting Person, conditions in the securities market and
general economic and

<PAGE>

CUSIP No. 957667108	 	13D	 	Page 4 of 7 Pages
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

industry conditions, the Reporting Person may in the future take such actions
with respect to their investment in the Issuer as it deems appropriate,
including, without limitation, purchasing additional Shares or selling some or
all of their Shares, engaging in short selling of or any hedging or similar
transactions with respect to the Shares and/or otherwise changing their
intention with respect to any and all matters referred to in this Item 4 of
Schedule 13D. The Reporting Person may, at any time and from time to time,
review or reconsider its position and/or change their purpose and/or formulate
plans or proposals with respect to their investment in the Shares.

The Reporting Person has not entered into any agreement with any third party
to act together for the purpose of acquiring, holding, voting or disposing of
the Shares reported herein.
