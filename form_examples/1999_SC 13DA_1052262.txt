                                 Amendment No. 1
                                 ---------------

       This Amendment No. 1 (the "Amendment No. 1") is filed by Jack Mark Benun,
Mark Jack Benun and Isaac Maurice Levy  (collectively,  the "Reporting Group" or
the "Management Shareholders") and amends and supplements the Schedule 13D filed
with the Securities and Exchange  Commission on July 23, 1999 (the "Statement"),
and is being filed  pursuant to Rule 13d-2 of the Securities and Exchange Act of
1934 (the  "Exchange  Act").  This  Amendment No. 1 is being filed in connection
with the execution of the  Agreement  and Plan of Merger,  dated as of September
17, 1999 (the "Merger  Agreement"),  by and between HK Merger  Corp.  ("HK") and
Happy Kids Inc.  (the  "Company"),  and certain other  documents and  agreements
executed  simultaneously in connection with the Merger Agreement.  The Reporting
Group  constitutes  a "group" for  purposes  of Rule 13d-5 under the  Securities
Exchange  Act of 1934,  as amended,  with  respect to Messrs.  Benun,  Benun and
Levy's respective  beneficial  ownership of the common stock, par value $.01 per
share, of the Company (the "Common Stock" or the "Shares").

       The undersigned  hereby amends Items 3, 4, 5, 6 and 7 of the Statement as
hereinafter set forth:

Item 3.Source and Amount of Funds or Other Consideration

       Item 3 of the  Statement  is hereby  amended to read in its  entirety  as
follows:

       General
       -------

       On July 12, 1999, the Company's Board of Directors (the "Board") received
for  consideration  a proposal  (the  "Proposal")  from H.I.G.  Capital,  L.L.C.
("H.I.G."),  a  private  investment  firm,  to  recapitalize  the  Company  in a
going-private transaction.  Certain terms and conditions of the Proposal are set
forth in that certain  Letter of Intent dated July 9, 1999,  entered into by and
among H.I.G. and each of the Reporting Persons,  which was filed as Exhibit 1 to
the Statement and is  incorporated  herein by reference.  On September 17, 1999,
the Company and HK Merger Corp. ("HK"), an affiliate of H.I.G.,  entered into an
Agreement and Plan of Merger (the "Merger Agreement"), whereby HK will be merged
with and into the Company (the "Merger") and the Company will be the corporation
surviving  the  Merger  (the  "Surviving  Corporation").  On the same  day,  the
Company's Board of Directors, in reliance upon the recommendation of its special
committee of disinterested  directors (the "Special Committee") and the fairness
opinion given by CIBC World  Markets Corp.  with respect to the $12.00 per share
consideration  to be paid to the  Company's  public  shareholders,  approved and
adopted  the Merger  Agreement  and the  transactions  contemplated  therein and
recommended   the  approval  and  adoption  of  the  Merger   Agreement  to  the
shareholders  of the  Company.  On that date,  the  Company  also issued a press
release announcing the execution of the Merger Agreement (the "Press Release").

       Merger Agreement
       ----------------

       Consideration and Conversion
       ----------------------------

       Under  the  terms of the  Merger  Agreement,  each  Share  held by public
shareholders  of the Company will be converted  into the right to receive $12.00
per share in cash without  interest.  The Reporting  Group , which  collectively
holds 74.69% of the Company's  outstanding Shares, will receive $7.164 per share
in cash for  6,874,652  Shares  (88.71% of their total  holdings of  outstanding
Shares) for an aggregate cash  consideration  of $49.25 million (as  applicable,
the "Merger  Consideration").  The remaining  Shares held by the Reporting Group
(an aggregate of 875,348  Shares) will be converted into shares of common stock,
par  value  $.01  per

                                       5

<PAGE>

share,  of  the  Surviving  Corporation  (the  "Surviving   Corporation  Stock")
representing a 23.61% equity interest in the Surviving  Corporation.  Each share
of common  stock,  par value $.01 per share,  of HK will be  converted  into one
share of Surviving Corporation Stock. H.I.G. has committed, through the purchase
of common  stock of HK, to  contribute  $20.3  million in equity  capital to the
Surviving Corporation.

       Immediately prior to the Effective Time (as defined below) of the Merger,
each  holder of a Company  stock  option to  purchase  the Common  Stock will be
entitled to receive a cash payment  equal to the product of (i) the total number
of  Shares  exercisable  pursuant  to the  holder's  stock  option  (except  for
non-employee  holders of a stock  option,  in which case this number will be the
total number of Shares subject to such option  regardless of whether or not such
stock  option is fully  exercisable  as of  closing)  and (ii) the excess of the
Merger  Consideration  over the exercise  price per Share  subject to such stock
option.  The  surrender  of a stock  option for payment will release all of such
holder's rights in the stock option and all  non-exercisable  stock options will
be canceled immediately prior the Effective Time.

       Effective Time
       --------------

       The Merger will become effective immediately upon filing a Certificate of
Merger with the New York  Department  of State in  accordance  with the relevant
provisions of the New York Business Corporation Laws (the "Effective Time"). The
Certificate  of Merger  will be filed  only upon  satisfaction  or waiver of the
conditions  contained in the Merger Agreement and only if no party has exercised
any right of termination provided in the Merger Agreement.  It is expected that,
after the  Effective  Time,  the  registration  of the  Company's  Common  Stock
pursuant to the  Exchange  Act will be  terminated  and the Common Stock will be
delisted from the Nasdaq National Market.

       Representations and Warranties
       ------------------------------

       Both  the  Company  and  HK  have  made  customary   representations  and
warranties set forth in Articles 3 and 4 of the Merger Agreement, including, but
not limited to, matters related to the  organization of both parties,  authority
of both parties relative to the Merger Agreement, the business and operations of
both  parties  and  compliance  of  both  parties  with  applicable   laws.  The

the Merger Agreement.

state statute, rule or regulation enacted after the date of the Merger Agreement
would impose a material  limitation  on the ability of HK to acquire or hold the
Company's  business and (iii) any waiting period under the Hart-Scott Rodino Act
applicable to the Merger has expired or been terminated.

       The   obligations  of  HK  to  consummate  the  Merger  are  subject  the

following:  (i) the truth and correctness of the  representations and warranties
of the Company in the Merger  Agreement  as of the date of the Merger  Agreement
and the  closing of the Merger  (the  "Closing"),  (ii) the  performance  of all
obligations  of the Company under the Merger  Agreement  prior to the Closing in
all material respects, (iii) the receipt by HK of licenses,  permits,  consents,
approvals, authorizations, qualifications and orders of governmental entities of

Agreement.

       The  obligations  of the Company to consummate the Merger are subject the
satisfaction and waiver of further conditions including, but not limited to, the
following:  (i) the truth and correctness of the  representations and warranties
of HK in the Merger  Agreement  as of the date of the Merger  Agreement  and the

four-year  5.7%   promissory   notes  in  an  aggregate   principal   amount  of
approximately $5.57 million,  issued to certain  shareholders in connection with
the  termination of the Company's S Corporation  status and (iv) no court in the
United  States or other  governmental  entity has  issued  any order,  decree or
ruling  or  undertaken  any  action  restraining,  enjoining  or  otherwise  (a)
prohibiting the  consummation of the Merger or transactions  contemplated in the
Merger Agreement,  (b) prohibiting of limiting the ownership or operation by the
Company or its subsidiaries of any material portion of their business or assets,
or to dispose of or hold separate any material  portion of business or assets or
(c) imposing  limitations on the ability of HK to acquire,  hold or exercise its
rights of  ownership  in the Shares,  including  the right to vote Shares on all
matters presented to the shareholders of the Company.

       No Solicitation
       ---------------

       Prior  to  October  15,   1999,   the   Company,   its   affiliates   and
representatives may (i) directly or indirectly solicit,  initiate, or encourage,

that the Company's Board or Special  Committee  determined in good faith that it
has a fiduciary  obligation to engage in such  negotiations or discussions,  (b)
withdrawing or modifying its  recommendation to the shareholders on the approval
and  adoption of the Merger  Agreement  to the extent that the  Company's  Board

and  14e-2 of the  Exchange  Act or by rules of any  self-regulating  securities

       The Merger  Agreement may be terminated  and the Merger  abandoned at any
time  prior  to  the  Effective  Time,   notwithstanding  the  approval  of  the
shareholders of the Company,  (i) by mutual consent of HK and the Company,  (ii)
by HK or the Company if the Merger is not  consummated on or before February 15,
2000 (unless such party has materially breached the Merger Agreement),  (iii) by
HK or the Company if any court in the United States or  governmental  entity has
issued any order,  decree or ruling or taken an action  restraining or enjoining
or otherwise prohibiting the Merger; provided the party seeking to terminate the
Merger  Agreement  has taken  reasonable  efforts to remove or lift such  order,
decree,  ruling or other action,  (iv) by the Company, if prior to the Effective
Time, a person has made a Formal Acquisition  Proposal (as defined in the Merger
Agreement)  or has  commenced a tender or exchange  offer for the Shares and the
Company's Board or Special Committee determines in good faith that its fiduciary
duties require it to accept such proposal,  (v) by HK if the Company's Board has
(a) failed to recommend to the Company's shareholders that they give shareholder
approval to the Merger,  (b) withdrawn or modified in a manner adverse to HK its
approval or  recommendation  of the Merger Agreement or Merger,  (c) approved or
recommended  an  Acquisition  Proposal  or (d)  resolved  to  effect  any of the
foregoing,  (vi) by  either HK or the  Company  if the  appropriate  shareholder
approval of the Merger is not  obtained and (vii) by either HK or the Company if
the other party is in material breach of the Merger Agreement and such breach is
not cured within 20 days.

       If the Merger  Agreement is terminated  pursuant to (iv) above,  or by HK
pursuant  to (ii)  above  due to a  material  breach  by the  Company,  or by HK
pursuant  to (v) or  (vii)  above  and  prior  to  such  termination  HK has not
materially  breached  the Merger  Agreement,  the Company will pay HK in cash $4
million within 3 days after such  termination.  The Merger Agreement will become
void and have no  force or  effect  upon  termination  of the  Merger  Agreement
pursuant to (i) through (iv) above;  provided,  however,  that such  termination
will not relieve any party of its  obligation  to pay certain  fees and payments
upon  termination  of the Merger  Agreement nor relieve any party from liability
for any  breach of a  covenant,  representation  or  warranty  under the  Merger
Agreement. See also Item 4. of this Amendment No. 1--the "Support Agreement."

       The  foregoing  discussion  of the Merger  Agreement and Press Release is
qualified in its entirety by reference to the Merger Agreement and Press Release
filed with this Amendment No. 1 as Exhibits 1. and 2. and incorporated herein by
reference.

       In connection with the Merger Agreement,  Messrs.  Benun,  Benun and Levy
(each a "Management Shareholder") and HK entered into a Support Agreement, dated
September 17, 1999 (the "Support Agreement"). Pursuant to the Support Agreement,
each  Management  Shareholder  agreed,  except  as  contemplated  in the  Merger
Agreement, to not (i) sell, transfer, pledge, assign or otherwise dispose of, or
enter into any contract or  arrangement to sell,  transfer,  assign or otherwise
dispose of any of his Shares to any  person  other than to HK or HK's  designee,
(ii) enter into any voting  arrangement with respect to his Shares or (iii) take
any other action that would in any way  restrict,  limit or  interfere  with the
performance of his obligations under the Support Agreement.

                                       8
<PAGE>


       Furthermore,  at any meeting of the Company's shareholders called to vote
upon the Merger and the Merger  Agreement,  or in any other  circumstances  upon
which a vote,  consent  or  approval  with  respect to the Merger and the Merger
Agreement is sought, each Management  Shareholder will, as requested by HK, vote
his Shares in favor of the Merger,  the adoption of the Merger Agreement and the
approval of other  transactions  contemplated  by the Merger  Agreement.  At any
meeting  of the  Company's  shareholders  or in any  circumstances  upon which a
Management  Shareholder's  vote,  consent  or other  approval  is  sought,  each
Management Shareholder will, as requested by HK, vote his Shares against (i) any
Alternative   Transactions   (as  defined   therein)  or  (ii)  any  Frustrating
Transactions (as defined therein).

       Non-Solicitation
       ----------------

       Each Management Shareholder also agrees not to (i) directly or indirectly
solicit,  initiate,  or encourage or take any other  action to  facilitate,  any
inquiries or proposals from any person that may constitute or reasonably lead to
an  Acquisition  Proposal  (as  defined  therein),  (ii) enter into or  maintain
discussions  and  negotiations  with any  person  in  furtherance  to  obtain an
Acquisition  Proposal,  (iii) agree to endorse any Acquisition  Proposal or (iv)
enter into any agreement,  arrangement or understanding requiring the Company to
abandon,  terminate or fail to consummate  the Merger or any other  transactions
contemplated by the Merger Agreement.

       Proxy
       -----

       Each Management  Shareholder  irrevocably  grants to and appoints to John
Black,  Rick  Rosen  and any  other  person  designated  by HK,  his  proxy  and
attorney-in-fact to vote his Shares or grant a consent or approval in respect of
such  Shares,  at any  meeting  of the  Company's  shareholders  or in any other
circumstances upon which their vote, consent or other approval is sought, (i) in
favor of the Merger, the adoption by the Company of the Merger Agreement and the
approval of the other transactions contemplated by the Merger Agreement and (ii)
against any Alternative Transaction or Frustrating Transaction.

       Indemnity and Escrow
       --------------------

       The  Management  Shareholders  will  deposit  $4,250,000  in cash into an
escrow  account,  established  pursuant  to an  escrow  agreement  (the  "Escrow
Agreement"),  to satisfy its indemnification obligations pursuant to the Support
Agreement.  Other than pursuant to the Support Agreement,  HK and its affiliates
will not assert  any  claims,  proceedings  or actions  against  any  Management
Shareholder  with  respect to the Merger  Agreement or any action or inaction of
the  Management  Shareholder  acting  in  his  capacity  as  officer,  director,
shareholder or employee of the Company occurring prior to the Merger (except for
fraudulent  acts).  Except as permitted  under the Escrow  Agreement,  after the
Effective  Time,  the  Management   Shareholders  will  not  assert  any  claim,
proceeding  or action  against the  Company,  HIG-HK  Investment,  Inc. or their
affiliates with respect to the Merger  Agreement,  the Support  Agreement or any
action or  inaction of the Company or HIG-HK  Investment,  Inc.  relating to the
Merger Agreement or the Support Agreement.

       The Management Shareholders, jointly and severally, will indemnify HK and
its affiliates,  officers, directors,  employees, agents and representatives and
HIG-HK  Investment,  Inc. and hold each such person  harmless  from any Loss (as
defined therein) which such person may suffer as a result of a breach by (i) the
Company of any  representation  or warranty set forth in Article 3 in the Merger
Agreement or (ii) the Management  Shareholders of any representation or warranty
set forth in the  Support  Agreement,  to the  extent  that  such  Loss  exceeds
$250,000, in which case the Management  Shareholders will be liable for the full
amount of the Loss. The indemnification  claim shall be limited to the amount in
the escrow in the Escrow Agreement

                                       9

<PAGE>

provided  however that the  Management  Shareholders  may have to indemnify  for
Losses in excess of the escrow amount for breaches of certain representations or
warranties of the Company in the Merger Agreement.

       Non-Competition
       ---------------

       For a period of 5 years after Closing,  each Management  Shareholder will
not (i) participate in the Company's Business (as defined therein), (ii) divulge
or appropriate  for use any secret or  confidential  information  concerning the
Business or (iii) solicit the  employment of or hire directly or indirectly  any
employee of the  Business or any person who was an employee  during the one year
preceding  such  solicitation  or hire without the prior written  consent of the
Company and HIG-HK Investment, Inc.

       Termination Fee
       ---------------

       In the event that the  Company  pays a  termination  fee  pursuant to the
Merger Agreement,  the Management Shareholders will jointly and severally pay HK
$1.5 million in cash within 10 days after the Company's  termination fee becomes
due. In addition, the Management  Shareholders will jointly and severally pay HK
in cash an Alternate  Transaction  Fee (as defined  therein) at the closing of a
transaction  that closes within 12 months of the date of the  termination of the
Merger Agreement wherein any of the Management Shareholders sell their Shares to
a person other than HK or an affiliate of HK.

       The  foregoing  discussion  of the Support  Agreement is qualified in its
entirety by reference to the Support  Agreement  filed with this Amendment No. 1
as Exhibit 3. and incorporated herein by reference.

       Shareholders Agreement
       ----------------------

       In connection  with the Merger  Agreement,  and in  contemplation  of the
Company's  continued  existence  after the  Merger as a "private  company",  the
Management Shareholders,  the Company, HIG-HK Investment,  Inc. ("Parent"),  and
each  other  persons  who  acquire  securities  and enters  into such  agreement
(collectively,  the  "Restricted  Shareholders"),  entered  into a  Shareholders
Agreement, dated September 17, 1999 (the "Shareholders Agreement").

       Board of Directors
       ------------------

       From and after the Effective Time, each holder of the Shareholder  Shares
(as  defined  therein)  will vote  their  shares and the  Company  will take all
actions so that:  (i) the number of  directors  on the  Company's  Board will be
established at a number which Parent will designate from time to time,  (ii) the
following  persons are elected to the Company's Board: (a) such  representatives
designated  by holders of a majority of Parent's  Shares  ("Parent  Directors"),
initially being John R. Black,  Rick Rosen,  Sami W. Mnaymneh,  Anthony A. Tamer
and John P. Bolduc and (b) Jack M. Benun,  Mark J. Benun,  Isaac Levy and Andrew
Glasgow (the "Management Directors"), (iii) the removal from the Company's Board
of any Parent  Director  will be only upon written  request of Parent,  (iv) the
removal from the Company's Board of any Management Director be only upon written
request  of the a  majority  of  Management  Directors,  (v) in  the  event  the
Management Director ceases to be an employee of the Company,  such director will
be removed as a director after his termination upon certain  conditions and (vi)
any vacancies on the Board will be filled by a  representative  appointed by the
remaining Parent Directors or Management Directors, as applicable.

       Restrictions on Transferability
       -------------------------------

                                       10

<PAGE>


       Subject to  limitations  in the  Shareholders  Agreement,  all Restricted
Shareholders  other  than  Parent  will not sell,  transfer,  assign,  pledge or
dispose of (a "Transfer") any of its  Shareholders  Shares without prior written
consent of Parent. Also, except with respect to a Permitted Transfer (as defined
therein), Parent must deliver to the other holders of Shareholder Shares written
notice of its intention to Transfer  Shareholder Shares and upon receipt of such
notice,  all  other  holders  of  Shareholder  Shares  will  have an  option  to
participate  in the  Transfer  on the same  terms as  offered  by  Parent to the
transferee.  Such  restrictions  set forth in this paragraph will cease upon the
earlier of (i) a Transfer of such  Shareholder  Shares through a Public Sale (as
defined therein), (ii) the consummation of an Approved Sale (as defined therein)
or (iii) the consummation of the Company's initial public offering of its equity
securities ("IPO").

       Repurchase Option
       -----------------

       In the event a Management  Shareholder  is no longer an employee with the
Company because of death or disability, such Management Shareholder may transfer
his Shareholder  Shares to the other Management  Shareholders or Parent.  In the
event a Management Shareholder is no longer an employee with the Company because
of his termination for Cause (as defined therein) or resigns without Good Reason
(as defined therein),  the Shareholder Shares may be purchased by Parent and the
purchase  price for each  Management  Shareholder's  Share will be the  Original
Value (as defined therein) for such Shareholder  Share. The Company may have the
option to purchase any Management Shareholder'  Shareholder Shares not purchased
by Parent.  Such  rights of  repurchase  will cease upon the  earlier of (i) the
consummation of an Approved Sale or (ii) the consummation of an IPO.

       Sale of the Company
       -------------------

       In the event the Board of Directors of the Company determines to sell all
or  substantially  all of the  assets  or  capital  stock of the  Company,  each
Management Shareholder will be given an opportunity to make an offer to purchase
such assets or stock of the Company.  If an Approved Sale occurs, all holders of
Shareholder  Shares  will  waive all  dissenters'  rights in a merger,  and each
holder of  Shareholder  Shares will agree to sell all of its Shares on the terms
of the Approved  Sale adopted by the  Company's  Board.  The  provisions of this
paragraph will cease upon consummation of an IPO.

       Preemptive Rights
       -----------------

       If the Company  authorizes the issuance or sale of its equity  securities
(other than as a dividend or pursuant to a registered public offering) to Parent
or its affiliates,  the Company will first offer to sell such securities to each
holder  of  Shareholder  Shares  at the same  terms  offered  to  Parent  or its
affiliates. Such rights, however, will terminate upon consummation of an IPO.

       The foregoing  discussion of the  Shareholders  Agreement is qualified in
its  entirety  by  reference  to the  Shareholders  Agreement  filed  with  this
Amendment No. 1 as Exhibit 4. and incorporated herein by reference.

     WHEREAS,  the  respective  Boards of  Directors  of HK and the Company have
approved  the merger of HK with and into the  Company,  as set forth  below (the
"Merger"),  in accordance with the New York Business Corporation Law (the "BCL")
and upon the terms and subject to the  conditions  set forth in this  Agreement,
holders of shares of common stock, par value $.01 per share, of the Company (the
"Common Shares") issued and outstanding  immediately prior to the Effective Time
(as defined below) will be entitled,  subject to the terms hereof and other than
as set forth herein,  to receive cash pursuant to this Agreement or, in the case
of certain specifically designated holders of Common Shares listed on Schedule I
attached  hereto (the  "Affliates"),  to receive  shares of common  stock of the
Surviving Corporation (as defined below);

     WHEREAS, the Board of Directors of the Company (the "Company Board"),  upon
the  recommendation  of its special  committee of  disinterested  Directors (the
"Special  Committee"),  has, in light of and subject to the terms and conditions
set forth herein:  (i) determined that (A) the consideration to be paid for each
Common Share held by shareholders other than the Affiliates (the "Non-Affiliated
Shares") in the Merger (as hereinafter  defined) is fair to such shareholders of
the  Company,  and (B) the  Merger is  otherwise  in the best  interests  of the
Company  and its  shareholders,  and (ii)  resolved  to  approve  and adopt this
Agreement and the transactions contemplated hereby and to recommend approval and
adoption by the shareholders of the Company of this Agreement;

     WHEREAS,  the Merger  requires the vote of  two-thirds of the votes cast by
all of the  issued  and  outstanding  Common  Shares  entitled  to vote  for the
approval thereof (the "Company Shareholder Approval");

     WHEREAS,  in order to  induce  HK to enter  into  this  agreement,  certain
shareholders  of the Company have entered into a Support  Agreement of even date
herewith;

     WHEREAS,  HK and  the  Company  desire  to  make  certain  representations,
warranties,  covenants and agreements in connection with the Merger, and also to
prescribe various conditions to the Merger; and

     NOW,  THEREFORE,  in  consideration  of the  foregoing  and the  respective

                                    ARTICLE 1

     Section 1.1 The Merger.  Upon the terms and subject to the  satisfaction or
waiver  of  the  conditions  hereof,  and  in  accordance  with  the  applicable
provisions  of this  Agreement  and the BCL, at the  Effective  Time HK shall be

     Section  1.2  Closing and  Effective  Time.  The closing of the Merger (the
"Closing") will take place at 10:00 a.m.,  local time, on the fifth business day
after  satisfaction or waiver of all of the conditions set forth in Article 4 of

which shall be  satisfied  or waived at the Closing) or such other date and time
as HK and the Company  may agree upon (the  "Closing  Date"),  at the offices of

further actions as may be required by law to make the Merger effective. The time
the Merger becomes  effective in accordance  with  applicable law is referred to
herein as the "Effective Time."

     Section 1.3 Effects of the  Merger.  The Merger  shall have the effects set
forth in the BCL. Without limiting the generality of the foregoing,  and subject
thereto, at the Effective Time, all the properties,  rights, privileges,  powers
and  franchises of the Company and HK shall vest in the  Surviving  Corporation,
and all debts,  liabilities  and duties of the Company  and HK shall  become the
debts, liabilities and duties of the Surviving Corporation.

     Section  1.4  Certificate  of  Incorporation  and  Bylaws of the  Surviving
Corporation.

          (a) The Certificate of Incorporation,  as amended,  of the Company, as
in effect  immediately  prior to the  Effective  Time and as further  amended to
provide for the number and types of shares of capital  stock  designated  on the
Rollover  Schedule  (as  hereinafter  defined),  shall  be  the  Certificate  of
Incorporation  of  the  Surviving   Corporation  until  thereafter   amended  in
accordance with the provisions thereof and hereof and applicable law.

          (b) The Bylaws of the Company in effect at the Effective Time shall be
the Bylaws of the Surviving Corporation until amended, subject to the provisions
of Section 5.6 of this Agreement,  in accordance with the provisions thereof and
applicable law.



                                       -2-

<PAGE>




     Section 1.5  Directors.  Subject to  applicable  law,  the  directors of HK
immediately  prior to the Effective  Time shall be the initial  directors of the
Surviving  Corporation and shall hold office until their  respective  successors
are duly elected and qualified, or their earlier death, resignation or removal.

     Section 1.6 Officers.  The officers of the Company immediately prior to the
Effective Time shall be the initial  officers of the Surviving  Corporation  and
shall hold  office  until  their  respective  successors  are duly  elected  and

Disclosure  Schedule  sets  forth the names and  titles of each  officer  of the
Company and each of its Subsidiaries as of the date hereof.

                                    ARTICLE 2
            EFFECT OF THE MERGER ON THE CAPITAL STOCK OF THE COMPANY

     Section 2.1 Effect on Capital Stock. As of the Effective Time, by virtue of
the Merger and without any action on the part of the holder of any Common Shares
or any shares of capital stock of HK:

          (a) Merger  Consideration.  The Merger Consideration shall be equal to
$12.00 per share, except for those Common Shares held by those holders of record
listed  in  the  Rollover   Schedule   (attached   hereto)   under  the  heading
"Non-Rollover  Shares," in which case the Merger Consideration shall be equal to
$7.164 per share for such Common Shares (i.e.  $49.25  million in the aggregate)
(as  applicable,   the  "Merger   Consideration").   In  addition,  the  parties
acknowledge  that the shares listed on the Rollover  Schedule  under the heading
"Rollover  Shares" (the  "Rollover  Shares") shall be retained by the holders of
such shares.

          (b) Conversion of Shares.

               (i) Each issued and  outstanding  Common Share  (except for those
Common Shares held by those  holders of record listed in the Rollover  Schedule,
but only up to the levels indicated in such Rollover  Schedule under the heading
"Rollover  Shares") shall, by virtue of the Merger and without any action on the
part of the holder  thereof,  be converted into the right to receive from HK the
Merger  Consideration,  as  applicable,  without  interest upon surrender of the
certificate formerly  representing such Common Shares in the manner provided in,
and otherwise in accordance  with,  Section 2.3 hereof.  All such Common Shares,
when so converted,  shall no longer be outstanding  and shall  automatically  be
canceled and retired and shall cease to exist,  and each holder of a certificate
representing  any such Common Shares shall cease to have any rights with respect
thereto,  except the right to receive the Merger Consideration therefor upon the
surrender of such certificate in the manner provided in, and in accordance with,
Section 2.3 hereof.

               (ii) At the Effective Time, (i) each Rollover Share and (ii) each
share of common stock,  par value $.01 per share,  of HK issued and  outstanding
immediately  prior to the  Effective  Time  shall,  by virtue of the  Merger and
without any action on the part of the holder


                                       -3-

<PAGE>




thereof,  be  converted  into and  become  one  validly  issued,  fully paid and
non-assessable share of common stock, par value $.01 per share, of the Surviving
Corporation.

          (c) Cancellation of Treasury Stock. Each Common Share that is owned by
the Company or by any wholly owned subsidiary of the Company shall automatically
be  canceled  and  retired  and  shall  cease  to  exist,  and no cash or  other
consideration shall be delivered or deliverable in exchange therefor.

     Section 2.2 Options;  Stock Plan.  Immediately prior to the Effective Time,
each holder of a  then-outstanding  employee  stock  option to  purchase  Common
Shares (an "Option")  granted  under the  Company's  1997 Stock Plan (the "Stock
Plan") will be entitled to receive in  settlement  of such Option a cash payment
(the "Option  Consideration")  from the Company  equal to the product of (i) the
total number of Common Shares previously subject to such Option, but only to the
extent  such  Option  is   exercisable  as  of  the  Closing  Date  (except  for
non-employee  holders of an Option, in which case this shall be the total number
of Common Shares previously subject to such Option whether or not such Option is
fully  exercisable  as of the  Closing  Date) and (ii) the  excess of the Merger
Consideration  over the exercise  price per Common Share subject to such Option,
subject to any required  withholding of taxes. The surrender of an Option to the
Company in exchange  for the Option  Consideration  shall be deemed a release of
any and all rights  the  holder  had or may have had in respect of such  Option.
Immediately  prior to the Effective Time, the Company will cause each Option (or
portion thereof) which is  non-exercisable  to be canceled.  The amounts payable
pursuant  to this  Section 2.2 shall be paid as soon as  reasonably  practicable
following  the  Closing  Date  and  shall  be  subject  to and  made  net of all
applicable withholding taxes.

     Section 2.3 Payment for Common Shares.

          (a) Prior to the Effective  Time,  HK and the Company shall  designate
the Company's  registrar and transfer  agent or such other bank or trust company
as may be approved by HK and the Company Board, to act as exchange agent for the
holders of Common Shares in connection with the Merger, pursuant to an agreement
providing  for the matters set forth in this Section 2.3 and such other  matters
as may be appropriate and the terms of which shall be reasonably satisfactory to
the Company and HK (the "Exchange Agent"), to receive the funds to which holders
of Common Shares shall become entitled pursuant to Section 2.1(b) hereof. At the
Effective Time, HK shall deposit, or HK shall otherwise take all steps necessary
to cause to be deposited, in trust with the Exchange Agent in an account for the
benefit of holders of Common Shares (the "Exchange  Fund") the aggregate  Merger
Consideration  to which  holders  of  Common  Shares  shall be  entitled  at the
Effective Time pursuant to Section 2.1(b) hereof.

          (b) Promptly after the Effective Time, and in any event not later than
three  business days  following the Effective  Time, HK shall cause the Exchange
Agent to mail to each record holder of certificates  (the  "Certificates")  that
immediately  prior to the Effective Time  represented  Common Shares (other than
Rollover  Shares) a form of letter  of  transmittal  which  shall  specify  that
delivery shall be effected, and risk of loss and title to the Certificates shall
pass, only


                                       -4-

<PAGE>




upon proper delivery of the Certificates or an Affidavit of Loss in Lieu of Lost
Certificate (as defined below) to the Exchange Agent and instructions for use in
surrendering such Certificates and receiving the Merger Consideration in respect
thereof.

          (c) In effecting the payment of the Merger Consideration in respect of
Common Shares (other than Rollover Shares) represented by Certificates  entitled
to payment of the Merger  Consideration  pursuant to Section 2.1(b) hereof, upon
the surrender of each such  Certificate,  together with a letter of  transmittal
duly  executed,  the Exchange Agent shall  promptly,  and in any event not later
than three business days following  receipt of such  Certificates  and letter of
transmittal,  pay  the  holder  of such  Certificate  the  Merger  Consideration
multiplied  by  the  number  of  Common  Shares  (other  than  Rollover  Shares)
represented by such Certificate,  in consideration  therefor.  Upon such payment
such Certificate shall forthwith be canceled.

          (d) Until  surrendered in accordance  with  paragraph (c) above,  each
such Certificate (other than Certificates  representing Common Shares held by HK
or any of its affiliates,  in the treasury of the Company or by any wholly owned
subsidiary of the Company or Rollover  Shares) shall represent  solely the right
to receive the aggregate Merger  Consideration  relating thereto. No interest or
dividends  shall be paid or accrued on the Merger  Consideration.  If the Merger
Consideration  (or any portion  thereof) is to be  delivered to any person other
than the  person in whose  name the  Certificate  formerly  representing  Common
Shares surrendered therefor is registered, it shall be a condition to such right
to receive such Merger  Consideration  that the Certificate so surrendered shall
be properly  endorsed or  otherwise  be in proper form for transfer and that the
person  surrendering  such Common  Shares  shall pay to the  Exchange  Agent any
transfer  or other  taxes  required  by  reason  of the  payment  of the  Merger
Consideration  to a person other than the registered  holder of the  Certificate
surrendered,  or shall establish to the  satisfaction of the Exchange Agent that
such tax has been paid or is not applicable.

          (e) In the event any  Certificate  shall  have  been  lost,  stolen or
destroyed, upon the making of an affidavit of that fact by the Person (who shall
be the record owner of such  Certificate)  claiming such Certificate to be lost,
stolen or destroyed (an  "Affidavit of Loss in Lieu of Lost  Certificate"),  the
Exchange  Agent  will  issue in  exchange  for such  lost,  stolen or  destroyed
Certificate the Merger  Consideration  deliverable in respect thereof,  provided
that the Person to whom the Merger  Consideration  is paid may,  as a  condition
precedent to the payment thereof, be required to give the Surviving  Corporation
a bond in such sum as it may direct or may  otherwise  be required to  indemnify
the Surviving  Corporation in a manner satisfactory to it against any claim that
may be made against the Surviving  Corporation  with respect to the  Certificate
claimed to have been lost, stolen or destroyed.

          (f) No dividends or other  distributions with respect to Common Shares
with a record date after the  Effective  Time shall be paid to the holder of any
unsurrendered  Certificate with respect to the Common Shares represented thereby
until the surrender of such  Certificates or delivery of an Affidavit of Loss in
Lieu of Lost Certificate in accordance with this Section 2.3.


                                       -5-

<PAGE>




          (g) Promptly  following the date which is 180 days after the Effective
Time,  the Exchange Agent shall deliver to the Surviving  Corporation  all cash,
Certificates and other documents in its possession  relating to the transactions
described in this Agreement,  and the Exchange  Agent's duties shall  terminate.
Thereafter,  each holder of a Certificate  formerly  representing a Common Share
(other than the Rollover Shares) may surrender such Certificate to the Surviving
Corporation and (subject to applicable  abandoned property,  escheat and similar
laws)  receive in  consideration  therefor the  aggregate  Merger  Consideration
relating thereto, without any interest or dividends thereon.

          (h) After the Effective Time, there shall be no transfers on the stock
transfer  books of the  Surviving  Corporation  of any Common  Shares which were
outstanding  immediately  prior to the Effective  Time.  If, after the Effective
Time,  Certificates formerly representing Common Shares (other than the Rollover
Shares) are presented to the Surviving  Corporation or the Exchange Agent,  they
shall be  surrendered  and  canceled in return for the payment of the  aggregate
Merger Consideration relating thereto, as provided in this Article 2.

          (i) None of HK, the Company or  Exchange  Agent shall be liable to any
person in  respect  of any cash from the  Exchange  Fund  delivered  to a public
official pursuant to any applicable abandoned property,  escheat or similar law.
If any Certificates  shall not have been surrendered  prior to seven years after
the Effective Time, any such shares, cash, dividends or distributions in respect
of such Certificate shall, to the extent permitted by applicable law, become the
property of the Surviving Corporation,  free and clear of all claims or interest
of any person previously entitled thereto.

                                    ARTICLE 3
                  REPRESENTATIONS AND WARRANTIES OF THE COMPANY

     The Company represents and warrants to HK as follows:

     Section 3.1 Organization and Qualification;  Subsidiaries; Investments. The
Company and each of its Subsidiaries  (as hereinafter  defined) is a corporation
duly  organized,  validly  existing and in good  standing  under the laws of its
state or jurisdiction of incorporation and has all requisite corporate power and
corporate authority to own, lease and operate its properties and to carry on its
business as now being conducted and is in good standing as a foreign corporation
in each  jurisdiction  where the properties  owned,  leased or operated,  or the
business conducted,  by it require such qualification and where failure to be in
good  standing  or to so qualify  would have a  Material  Adverse  Effect on the
Company.  The term  "Material  Adverse  Effect on the  Company," as used in this
Agreement,  means any effect, event,  occurrence,  change or state of facts that
is, or when  aggregated  with other  effects,  events,  occurrences,  changes or
states of facts, is, or is reasonably  likely to be,  materially  adverse to (i)
the assets, liabilities,  business, property,  operations or financial condition
of the Company and its Subsidiaries taken as a whole, or (ii) the ability of the
Company and its  Subsidiaries,  taken as a whole,  to perform their  obligations
under this Agreement. The Company has heretofore made available to HK a complete
and correct copy of its Certificate of


                                       -6-

<PAGE>




Incorporation, as amended, and Bylaws. Except as set forth on Section 3.1 of the
Disclosure  Schedule,  there  is  no  corporation,  limited  liability  company,
partnership or other business  organization  or entity of which the Company owns
either directly or through its Subsidiaries,  (a) more than 50% of (i) the total
combined voting power of all classes of voting  securities of such entity,  (ii)
the total  combined  equity  interests  therein,  or (iii) the capital or profit
interests  therein,  in the case of a  partnership;  or (b) or otherwise has the
power to vote or direct the voting of sufficient  securities to elect a majority
of the  board  of  directors  or  similar  governing  body of such  entity  (the
"Subsidiaries"). Except as set forth on Schedule 3.1 of the Disclosure Schedule,
neither the Company  nor any  Subsidiary  owns or holds the right to acquire any
shares of stock or any other security or interest in any other person.

     Section 3.2 Capitalization;  Subsidiaries.  The authorized capital stock of
the  Company  consists  of  30,000,000  Common  Shares and  5,000,000  shares of
preferred stock, par value $.01 per share ("Preferred  Stock").  As of the close
of business on September  17,  1999,  10,375,693  Common  Shares were issued and
outstanding,  all of which are  entitled  to vote on this  Agreement  except for
those  shares held in  treasury.  The Company has no shares of  Preferred  Stock
issued and  outstanding.  As of September  17, 1999,  except for 305,000  Common
Shares reserved for issuance pursuant to outstanding  Options and rights granted
under the Stock Plan,  there are not now, and at the  Effective  Time there will
not be, any existing options, warrants, calls,  subscriptions,  or other rights,
or other agreements or commitments, obligating the Company to issue, transfer or
sell any shares of  capital  stock of the  Company  or any of its  Subsidiaries.
Section 3.2 of the Disclosure  Schedule sets forth the name of each holder of an
outstanding Option under the Stock Plan, and with respect to each Option held by
any such holder, the grant date, vesting schedule,  exercise price and number of
Common Shares for which such Option is  exercisable.  All issued and outstanding
Common  Shares are, and all Common  shares  which may be issued  pursuant to the
exercise of  outstanding  Options  will be, when issued in  accordance  with the
respective terms thereof,  validly issued, fully paid, nonassessable and free of
preemptive rights. All of the outstanding shares of capital stock of each of the
Company's  Subsidiaries  have  been  validly  issued  and  are  fully  paid  and
non-assessable  and,  except  as set  forth  on  Section  3.2 of the  Disclosure
Schedule,  are owned by either the Company or another of its  Subsidiaries  free
and  clear  of  all  liens,  charges,  claims  or  encumbrances.  There  are  no
outstanding options, warrants, calls,  subscriptions,  or other rights, or other
agreements or  commitments,  obligating  any Subsidiary of the Company to issue,
transfer or sell any shares of its capital stock.

     Section 3.3 Authority Relative to this Agreement.

          (a) The Company has all  necessary  corporate  power and  authority to
execute  and  deliver  this  Agreement  and,  except  for the  approval  of this
Agreement by the  shareholders  of the Company,  to consummate the  transactions
contemplated  hereby.  The  execution  and  delivery of this  Agreement  and the
consummation of the transactions  contemplated hereby have been duly and validly
authorized by the Company Board upon the recommendation of the Special Committee
and no other corporate  proceedings on the part of the Company or on the part of
the  shareholders of the Company are necessary to authorize this Agreement or to
consummate the


                                       -7-

<PAGE>




transactions  so  contemplated,  other than the  approval of this  Agreement  by
two-thirds  of the issued and  outstanding  Common  Shares of the Company.  This
Agreement has been duly and validly  executed and delivered by the Company,  and
this  Agreement  constitutes  a valid  and  binding  agreement  of the  Company,
enforceable against the Company in accordance with its terms.

          (b) Except as set forth in Section 3.3 of the Disclosure Schedule, the
execution and delivery of this Agreement does not, and the  consummation  of the
transactions  contemplated  by this Agreement and compliance with the provisions

circumstances  under  which they were made,  not  misleading.  The  audited  and
unaudited  consolidated  financial statements of the Company included in the SEC

principles  applied on a consistent  basis  (except as otherwise  stated in such
financial  statements,  including  the  related  notes) and fairly  present  the

since such date neither the Company nor any of such  Subsidiaries  has incurred,
any  liabilities  or  obligations  of any  nature  (whether  accrued,  absolute,
contingent  or  otherwise)  which,  individually  or  in  the  aggregate,  would
reasonably  be expected to have a Material  Adverse  Effect with  respect to the
Company except liabilities incurred in the ordinary and usual course of business
and consistent  with past practice and  liabilities  incurred in connection with
the transactions contemplated by this Agreement.

          (b) All accounts receivable of the Company (the "Accounts Receivable")
represent or will represent  valid  obligations  arising from services  actually
performed  in the  ordinary  course  of  business  and are  subject  to no valid
counterclaims  or setoffs.  Unless paid prior to the Closing Date,  the Accounts
Receivable are or will be as of the Closing Date current and  collectible net of
reserves.  Subject to such reserves,  each of the Accounts Receivable either has
been or will be  collected in full,  without any set-off,  within 120 days after
the day on which it first  becomes  due and  payable.  Except  as  disclosed  in
Section 3.4(b) of the Disclosure  Schedule,  since December 31, 1998, there have
been no material returns, allowances or charge-backs.

Subsidiaries to carry on their business as presently conducted or as proposed to
be  conducted,  except  for  such  failures  to  have  such  permits,  licenses,
certifications  or  regulatory  authorizations  or  approvals  that  would  not,
individually  or in the  aggregate,  reasonably  be  expected to have a Material
Adverse Effect on the Company, and all such permits are valid, and in full force


                                       -9-

and effect and there exists no default thereunder and (ii) the operations of the
Company and its  Subsidiaries  have been conducted in compliance  with all laws,
ordinances,  regulations,  judgments  and  decrees  of any  Governmental  Entity

for possible violations which would not, individually or in the aggregate,  have
a Material Adverse Effect on the Company.

     Section  3.6  Litigation.  Except  as  set  forth  on  Section  3.6  of the
Disclosure   Schedule,   there  is  no  suit,  claim,   action,   proceeding  or
investigation pending or, to the knowledge of the Company, threatened, at law or
in equity, or before any Governmental Entity,  against the Company or any of its
Subsidiaries,  individually  or in the  aggregate,  which  would have a Material
Adverse  Effect on the  Company and its  Subsidiaries  taken as a whole or could
prevent or materially delay the consummation of the transactions contemplated by
this  Agreement.  Except as disclosed in the SEC Reports filed prior to the date
of this Agreement, neither the Company nor any of its Subsidiaries is subject to

Internal  Revenue Code of 1986, as amended,  including the Treasury  Regulations
thereunder  (the "Code") and all laws and  regulations  applicable to the Plans.
With respect to each Plan that is intended to be a  "qualified  plan" within the
meaning of Section 401(a) of the Code  ("Qualified  Plans"),  (i) such Plan is a
Qualified Plan within the meaning of Section 401(a) of the Code,  (ii) except to

ERISA,  (iii) Sections 412 and 4971 of the Code, (iv) the continuation  coverage
requirements  of section 601 et seq. of ERISA and Section  4980B of the Code, or

limiting the generality of the foregoing,  none of the Company, its Subsidiaries
nor any ERISA Affiliate of the Company or any of its Subsidiaries has engaged in
any  transaction  described in Section 4069 or Section 4204 or 4212 of ERISA. An
"ERISA  Affiliate"  means any entity,  trade or business  that is, or during the

occurred with respect to any of the Real Property that,  individually  or in the
aggregate, has had or resulted in, or is reasonably likely to have or result in,
a Material Adverse Effect on the Company.

          (f) Condition and Operation of  Improvements.  All buildings and other
improvements  included within the Real Property (the "Improvements") are in good
condition and repair and adequate to operate such  facilities as currently used,
and, to the Company's Knowledge,  there are no facts or conditions affecting any
of the Improvements which would, individually or in the aggregate,  interfere in
any  significant  respect with the current use,  occupancy or operation  thereof
which  interference  would,  individually  or in the  aggregate,  reasonably  be
expected to have


                                      -24-

a Material  Adverse Effect on the Company.  No Improvement or portion thereof is
dependent  for its access,  operation or utility on any land,  building or other
improvement not included in the Real Property.

          (g) Permits.  All required or appropriate  certificates  of occupancy,
permits, licenses, franchises,  approvals and authorizations (collectively,  the
"Real Property  Permits") of all governmental  authorities  having  jurisdiction
over the Real  Property,  the  absence of which  could  have a Material  Adverse
Effect on the  Company,  have  been  issued to the  Company  to enable  the Real
Property to be lawfully  occupied  and used for all of the purposes for which it
is currently occupied and used have been lawfully issued and are, as of the date
hereof, in full force and effect. The Company has delivered complete and correct
copies of the Real Property  Permits to HK. The Company has not received or been
informed by a third party of the receipt by it of any notice  which could have a
Material  Adverse Effect on the Company from any  governmental  authority having
jurisdiction  over the  Real  Property  threatening  a  suspension,  revocation,
modification  or  cancellation  of any Real  Property  Permit  and,  to the best
Knowledge of the Company,  there is no basis for the issuance of any such notice
or the taking of any such action.

Trade Laws and  Regulations  applicable in connection  with the conduct of their

The  Company's  business  relationships  with its  suppliers  hold  the  Company
harmless,  and may be canceled by the Company without penalty or forfeiture,  in
the event that its suppliers  violate any such  applicable  International  Trade
Laws and Regulations.

other party the  opportunity to attend and participate  thereat.  Subject to the
Confidentiality  Agreement,  each of the  parties  hereto  will  coordinate  and
cooperate fully with the other parties hereto in exchanging such information and

benefit  and  welfare  plans,  programs,  contracts,   agreements  and  policies

which are  currently  provided by the  Company;  provided  that  notwithstanding
anything in this Agreement to the contrary the Surviving  Corporation  shall not
be required to maintain  any  individual  plan or program so long as the benefit
plan  and  agreements  maintained  by  the  Surviving  Corporation  are,  in the
aggregate,  not less favorable  than those  provided by the Company  immediately
prior to the date of this Agreement;  and,  provided,  further,  that nothing in

arising out of or related to matters, actions or omissions or alleged actions or
omissions  occurring  at or prior to the  Effective  Time  whether  asserted  or

Surviving  Corporation to, periodically  advance expenses (including  attorney's
fees) as incurred by an Indemnified  Person with respect to the foregoing to the
full extent permitted under applicable law, and (ii) any determination  required
to be made with  respect to whether an  Indemnified  Party  shall be entitled to

Time, the Surviving Corporation,  shall cause to be maintained in effect for not
less than six years from the Effective  Time the policies of the  directors' and
officers'  liability  insurance  maintained  by the  Company and in effect as of
September  1, 1999;  provided  that the  Surviving  Corporation  may  substitute
therefor other policies of at least the same coverage  amounts and which contain
terms and conditions not less  advantageous to the  beneficiaries of the current
policies and, provided further,  that such substitution  shall not result in any
gaps or lapses in coverage with respect to matters  occurring on or prior to the
Effective Time; and provided further,  that the Surviving  Corporation shall not
be  required  to pay an annual  premium  in  excess  of 200% of the last  annual
premium  paid by the  Company  prior to the  date  hereof  and if the  Surviving
Corporation is unable to obtain the insurance required by this Section 5.6(b) it
shall obtain as much  comparable  insurance  as possible  for an annual  premium
equal to such maximum amount.

          (c) This Section 5.6 shall survive the  consummation  of the Merger at
the  Effective  Time,  is  intended  to  benefit  the  Company,   the  Surviving
Corporation and the Indemnified Parties,  shall be binding on all successors and
assigns of HK and the Surviving  Corporation,  and shall be  enforceable  by the
Indemnified Parties.

promptly notify each other of (i) the occurrence or  non-occurrence  of any fact
or event which would be  reasonably  likely (A) to cause any  representation  or
warranty  contained in this Agreement to be untrue or inaccurate in any material
respect at any time from the date hereof to the  Effective  Time or (B) to cause
any  covenant,  condition or agreement  under this  Agreement not to be complied
with or satisfied  and (ii) any failure of the  Company,  or HK, as the case may
be, to comply  with or  satisfy  any  covenant,  condition  or  agreement  to be
complied  with or satisfied by it  hereunder;  provided,  however,  that no such
notification shall affect the  representations or warranties of any party or the
conditions to the obligations of any party hereunder. Each of the Company and HK
shall  give  prompt  notice to the other  parties  hereof of any notice or other
communication from any third party alleging that the consent of such third party
is or may be required in connection with the  transactions  contemplated by this
Agreement.

          recapitalization,  business  combination or other similar  transaction
          involving any material portion of the assets or any securities of, any

          foregoing   by,  the  Company  or  any  of  its   Subsidiaries   (such
          transactions being referred to herein as "Acquisition Proposals");

                    (ii)  enter  into,  maintain,  or  continue  discussions  or
          negotiations  with any person in  furtherance  of such inquiries or to

          any such action;



               provided,  however,  that prior to the  approval of the Merger by
the  shareholders  of the Company  nothing in this Agreement  shall prohibit the
Company Board or the Special  Committee from (A) furnishing  information to, and
engaging in discussions or negotiations with, any person or entity that makes an
unsolicited  written,  bona fide  proposal  to acquire  the  Company  and/or its
Subsidiaries pursuant to a merger, consolidation,  share exchange, tender offer,
recapitalization,  business  combination  or other similar  transaction,  or any
transaction  involving  the sale of a  material  portion  of the  assets  of the

determines in good faith, after consulting with independent legal counsel (which
may be the Company's  regularly  engaged outside legal  counsel),  that it has a
fiduciary  obligation to furnish such  information or engage in such discussions
or  negotiations  with such person or entity  (any such  proposal  meeting  such
criteria, a "Superior Proposal"), provided,


                                      -35-

<PAGE>




that prior to taking such action,  the Company notifies HK of its intentions and
obtains an  executed  confidentiality  agreement  from the  appropriate  parties
substantially similar to the Confidentiality  Agreement,  (B) failing to make or
withdrawing or modifying its  recommendation  referred to in Section 5.12 hereof
if  the  Company  Board  or  the  Special  Committee,  after  consultation  with
independent  legal counsel (who may be the Company's  regularly  engaged outside
legal counsel),  determines in good faith that it has a fiduciary  obligation to
do so,  provided  that  HK is  given  two  days'  prior  written  notice  of its
intentions to do so, and (C) disclosing to the Company's shareholders a position
contemplated  by Rules 14d-9 and 14e-2  promulgated  under the Exchange Act with
respect to any tender offer, or taking any other legally required action, or any
action  required by the rules or regulations of any  self-regulating  securities
exchange,  market or other body (including,  without  limitation,  the making of
public  disclosure as may be necessary or advisable under applicable  securities
laws); and, provided further,  that notwithstanding  anything to the contrary in
this Agreement,  the Company Board's or the Special Committee's  exercise of its
rights under  clause (A), (B) or (C) above shall not  constitute a breach by the
Company of this Agreement.

          (c) The Company will  promptly  notify HK of the receipt of any Formal
Acquisition Proposal, the terms and conditions of such proposal and the identity
of the person making it. The Company also will promptly  notify HK of any change
to or  modification  of such  Formal  Acquisition  Proposal  and the  terms  and
conditions thereof.

          (d) To the extent that,  as of October 15, 1999,  the Company,  any of
its  affiliates  or any  Company  Representative  is engaged in  discussions  or
negotiations  with any  person or entity  (other  than HK) with  respect  to any
proposal that does not at such time constitute a Superior Proposal as defined in
(b) above,  the Company  shall,  and shall cause its  affiliates and the Company
Representatives to, cease any and all activities, discussions or negotiations as
of such date.  Nothing in this Section 5.9(d) is intended to prevent,  deter, or
prohibit  the  Company  Board or the  Special  Committee  from taking any action
permitted  by Section  5.9(b)  above and the taking of any such action shall not
constitute a breach of this provision.

          duly call,  give notice of, convene and hold a special  meeting of its
          shareholders (the "Special Meeting") as soon as practicable  following
          the  execution of this  Agreement for the purpose of  considering  and
          taking action upon this Agreement;

                    (ii)  prepare  and  file  with the SEC a  preliminary  proxy
          statement  relating to this Agreement,  and use its reasonable efforts
          (A) to obtain and furnish the  information  required to be included by
          the SEC in a definitive  proxy statement (the "Proxy  Statement") and,
          after  consultation  with HK, to respond promptly to any comments made
          by the SEC with respect to the  preliminary  proxy statement and cause
          the Proxy Statement to be mailed to its  shareholders  and (B) subject
          to the fiduciary  duties of the Company Board, to obtain the necessary
          approvals of the Merger and this Agreement by its shareholders; and

                    (iii) subject to the fiduciary  duties of the Company Board,
          include in the Proxy Statement the recommendation of the Company Board
          that shareholders of the Company vote in favor of the approval of this
          Agreement.

material respects with the provisions of applicable federal securities laws and,
on the date filed with the SEC and on the date first published, sent or given to
the Company's shareholders, shall not contain any untrue statement of a material
fact or omit to state  any  material  fact  required  to be  stated  therein  or
necessary  in  order  to make  the  statements  made  therein,  in  light of the
circumstances  under  which  they were  made,  not  misleading,  except  that no
representation is made by the Company with respect to information supplied by HK
in writing for inclusion in the Proxy Statement. Each of the Company, on the one
hand,  and HK, on the other hand,  agree  promptly  to correct  any  information
provided by either of them for use in the Proxy  Statement  if and to the extent
that it shall have become false or misleading, and the Company further agrees to
take all steps  necessary  to cause the Proxy  Statement  as so  corrected to be

case, as and to the extent required by applicable federal securities laws.

reasonable efforts to cause to be delivered to HK from the Company's independent

registration  and other fees or any similar  taxes which  become  payable by the
Company  or  any  of  its  Subsidiaries  in  connection  with  the  transactions
contemplated  by this Agreement that are required or permitted to be filed on or

          (b) In the event that this Agreement is terminated pursuant to Section

breach of this Agreement by the Company, or by HK pursuant to Sections 7.1(e) or

Fee"), and no amount will be owed to HK pursuant to clause (a) above.

          (c) The  prevailing  party in any legal action  undertaken  to enforce

          (d) Except as otherwise  specifically provided for herein,  whether or
not the Merger is  consummated,  all costs and expenses  incurred in  connection
with this Agreement and the transactions contemplated by this Agreement shall be
paid by the party incurring such expenses.

Suite 2708

Attention:  Sami Mnaymneh


re  Commitment Letter


Gentlemen:

         You have advised Bankers Trust Company ("BTCo") that H.I.G. Capital LLC
("HIG") is considering a  recapitalization  transaction (the  "Acquisition")  of
Happy  Kids Inc.  (the  "Company")  pursuant  to which HIG,  certain  management
shareholders  of the Company and other  investors  reasonably  acceptable  to us
(collectively, the "Equity Investors") would own 100% (on a fully diluted basis)
of the equity of the Company.  We understand that (i) the purchase price for the
equity  of the  Company  will be  $81,100,000  and  (ii)  concurrently  with the
consummation of the Acquisition,  the Company will refinance  $14,200,000 of its
existing debt (the  "Refinancing"  and,  together with the  Acquisition  and the
incurrence  of the  financings  described  below,  the  "Transaction").  We also
understand  that  the  Acquisition  will  be  structured  as a  one-step  merger
transaction  pursuant to which a company  newly  formed by the Equity  Investors
would  merge with and into the  Company,  with the Company  being the  surviving
corporation.

         BTCo  understands  that  the  aggregate  funds  needed  to  effect  the
Acquisition  and the  Refinancing  will be  $95,300,000  and  that  the fees and
expenses  incurred in  connection  with the  Transaction  will be  approximately
$5,500,000.  BTCo further  understands  that the funding  required to effect the
Acquisition  and the  Refinancing,  to pay fees and expenses owing in connection
with the  Transaction  and to provide  working  capital to the  Company  and its
subsidiaries shall be provided solely as follows: (i) a cash equity contribution
(the "Equity  Financing") from the Equity Investors in the amount of $26,575,000
(of which up to $6,275,000  may be in the form of roll-over  equity  retained by
certain   existing   management   shareholders   of  the  Company  (the  "Equity
Rollover")),  (ii) the  issuance  by the  Company  of  subordinated  notes


<PAGE>


(the  "Subordinated  Notes")  generating  gross cash proceeds of $10,000,000 and
(iii) the incurrence by the Company of the Senior  Secured  Financing as defined
and described below.

         BTCo  understands  that the senior bank financing (the "Senior  Secured
Financing")  required by the Company to effect the foregoing  transactions  will
consist of (i) a $60,000,000  term loan facility (the "Term Loan  Facility") and
(ii) a $50,000,000  revolving  credit facility (the "Revolving  Credit Facility"
and, together with the Term Loan Facility,  the "Credit  Facilities"),  it being
understood that  approximately  $10,500,000 of the Revolving Credit Facility may
be utilized to effect the  Acquisition  and the  Refinancing and to pay any fees
and expenses owing in connection with the  Transaction.  A summary of certain of
the terms and  conditions  of the  Credit  Facilities  is set forth on Exhibit A
hereto (the "Term Sheet").

         BTCo is pleased to confirm that (i) it commits to provide, on the terms
and conditions set forth herein and in the Term Sheet, all of the Senior Secured
Financing,  (ii) it will act as sole  Administrative  Agent for a  syndicate  of
financial institutions (the "Lenders") party to the Senior Secured Financing and
(iii) Deutsche Bank Securities Inc. ("DBSI"),  an affiliate of BTCo, will act as
sole Lead Arranger and sole Book Manager for the Senior Secured  Financing.  You
agree that no other agents,  co-agents or arrangers will be appointed,  no other
titles  will  be  awarded  and  no  compensation   (other  than  that  expressly
contemplated  by the Term Sheet and the Fee Letter  referred  to below)  will be
paid in connection with the Senior Secured  Financing unless you and we shall so
agree.

         BTCo reserves the right,  prior to or after execution of the definitive
credit documentation for the Senior Secured Financing,  to syndicate all or part
of its  commitment  for the  Senior  Secured  Financing  to one or more  Lenders
pursuant to a syndication to be managed by BTCo. BTCo shall commence syndication
efforts  promptly after your acceptance of this letter and you agree to actively
assist BTCo in  achieving  a  syndication  that is  satisfactory  to BTCo.  Such
syndication will be accomplished by a variety of means, including direct contact
during the  syndication  between  senior  management  and  advisors of HIG,  the
Company and the proposed  syndicate  members.  To assist BTCo in its syndication
efforts,  you hereby  agree,  both  before  and after the  closing of the Senior
Secured  Financing,  (i) to provide and cause your  advisors to provide BTCo and
the other syndicate members upon request with all information  reasonably deemed
necessary  by  BTCo to  complete  syndication,  including  but  not  limited  to
information and evaluations  prepared by HIG and the Company or by your or their
respective  advisors  relating  to the  Transaction  and the other  transactions
contemplated  hereby,  (ii) to assist BTCo upon request in the preparation of an

decline to provide or participate in the proposed financing.

         You hereby agree to pay all  reasonable  costs and expenses of BTCo and
its affiliates  (including the reasonable  fees and expenses of White & Case LLP
and other counsel to BTCo and BTCo's and its affiliates' out-of-pocket expenses)
arising in  connection  with the  preparation,  execution  and  delivery of this

or definitive  credit documents are executed.  In addition,  you hereby agree to
indemnify and hold  harmless  each of the Lenders  (including in any event BTCo)
and each director,  officer,  employee, agent and affiliate thereof (each of the
foregoing  entities  an  "indemnified  person") in  connection  with any losses,
claims, damages, liabilities or other expenses to which such indemnified persons
may become subject,  insofar as such losses,  claims,  damages,  liabilities (or
actions or other  proceedings  commenced or  threatened  in respect  thereof) or
other  expenses  arise  out  of or in any  way  relate  to or  result  from  the
Transaction  or this letter or the  extension  of the Senior  Secured  Financing
contemplated by this letter, or in any way arise from any use or intended use of
this letter or the proceeds of the Senior Secured Financing contemplated by this
letter,  and you agree to  reimburse  each  indemnified  person for any legal or
other  expenses  incurred  in  connection  with   investigating,   defending  or
participating  in any such loss,  claim,  damage,  liability  or action or other

proceeding  out of which such expenses  arise),  provided that you shall have no
obligation  to indemnify any  indemnified  person for any loss,  claim,  damage,
expense or liability to the extent that same resulted  primarily  from the gross
negligence or willful  misconduct of such indemnified person (as determined by a
court of competent  jurisdiction in a final and non-appealable  decision).  This
letter is  furnished  for your  benefit  only and may not be relied  upon by any
other  person  or  entity.  Neither  BTCo  nor any of its  affiliates  shall  be

         BTCo  reserves  the right to employ  the  services  of its  affiliates,
including  DBSI,  in providing the services  contemplated  by this letter and to
allocate,  in whole or in part, to such affiliates  certain fees payable to BTCo
in such manner as BTCo and its  affiliates  may agree in their sole  discretion.
You  acknowledge  that  BTCo  may  share  with any of its  affiliates,  and such
affiliates may share with BTCo, any  information  relating to the Transaction or

                           remaining  scheduled  amortizations of the Term Loans
                           on pro rata basis.

                           to be repaid in full and all  commitments  in respect
                           of the Credit  Facilities  shall  terminate  upon the
                           occurrence  of a "change of control" of the  Borrower

                           allow each  assignee to become a direct  signatory to
                           the Credit  Facilities and will relieve the assigning
                           Lender  of  its  obligations   with  respect  to  the

          Re: Happy Kids Recapitalization Financing
              -------------------------------------

Gentlemen:

          We understand that you intend to consummate a recapitalization (the
"Recapitalization") of Happy Kids, Inc. (the "Company"), to be accomplished by
merger of a newly formed company ("Acquisition Corp.") owned by you and/or your
affiliates and other investors reasonably satisfactory to the Lender (the
"Equity Investors") with and into the Company, with the Company as the surviving
entity. We further understand that the cash requirements for the
Recapitalization, the refinancing of approximately $14.2 million of existing
debt of the Company and its subsidiaries (the "Refinancing") and related fees
and expenses will be approximately $100.8 million and will be provided solely
from (i) term loan facilities (the "Term Loan Facilities") of up to $60 million,
(ii) a revolving credit facility (the "Revolving Credit Facility" and, together
with the Term Loan Facilities, the "Bank Financing") of up to $50 million of
which it is estimated approximately $10.5 million will be drawn as of the
closing date of the Recapitalization (the "Closing Date"), (iii) a common equity
contribution to the Company of at least $26.575 million, $20.3 million of which
will be contributed in cash by the Equity Investors and up to $6.275 million of
which may be in the form of rollover equity of existing shareholders of the
Company (the "Equity Financing") and (iv) up to $10 million from the issuance of
senior subordinated debt of the Company. The Recapitalization, the Bank
Financing, the Equity Financing, the Refinancing and the issuance of senior
subordinated debt are herein collectively referred to as the "Transaction".

<PAGE>

                                      -2-

          You have requested that Bankers Trust Corporation (the "Lender")
commit to provide to the Company funds in the amount of up to $10 million in the
form of a senior subordinated loan (or note issuance) to be made available as
described in Section 1 hereof (the "Senior Subordinated Financing").

          Accordingly, subject to the terms and conditions set forth or
incorporated in this letter, the Lender agrees with you as follows:

          Section 1. Senior Subordinated Financing. The Lender hereby commits,
subject to the terms and conditions hereof and in the Summary Term Sheet
attached hereto as Exhibit A (the "Term Sheet"), to provide to the Company a
senior subordinated loan (which at the option of the Lender may take the form of
senior subordinated notes) in the aggregate principal amount of up to $10
million. The proceeds of the Senior Subordinated Financing shall be used,
together with the proceeds of the Bank Financing and the Equity Financing,
solely to finance the Recapitalization, to consummate the Refinancing and to pay
fees and expenses incurred in connection with the Recapitalization. The
principal terms of the Senior Subordinated Financing are summarized in the Term
Sheet.

          Unless the Lender's commitment hereunder shall have been terminated
pursuant to Section 6, the Lender or its affiliates shall have the exclusive
right to provide the Senior Subordinated Financing or other mezzanine financing
required in connection with the Transaction.

          You hereby represent and covenant that based on your review and
analysis, to the best of your knowledge (a) all information other than
Projections (as defined below), which has been or is hereafter made available to
the Lender by you or your representatives, advisors or affiliates in connection
with the transactions contemplated hereby (the "Information") has been reviewed
and analyzed by you in connection with the performance of your own due diligence
and is, or in the case of Information made available after the date hereof will
be, complete and correct in all material respects and does not and will not
contain any untrue statement of a material fact or omit to state a material fact
known to you and necessary to make the statements contained therein, in the
light of the circumstances under which such statements were or are made, not
misleading and (b) all financial projections concerning the Company that have
been or are hereafter made available to the Lender by you or your
representatives, advisors or affiliates in connection with the transactions
contemplated hereby (the

<PAGE>

                                      -3-

"Projections") have been or, in the case of Projections made available
after the date hereof, will be prepared in good faith based upon reasonable
assumptions (it being understood that the Projections are subject to significant
uncertainties and contingencies, many of which are beyond your control and that
no assurance can be given that such Projections will be realized). You agree to
supplement the Information and the Projections from time to time until the
termination of the Lender's commitment hereunder so that the representation and
warranty made in the preceding sentence is correct as of such date. In arranging
and syndicating the Senior Subordinated Financing, the Lender will be using and
relying on the Information and the Projections without independent verification
thereof. The representations and covenants contained in this paragraph shall
remain effective until a definitive financing agreement is executed and
thereafter the disclosure representations contained herein shall be terminated
and of no further force and effect.

          Section 2. Financing Documentation. The making of the Senior
Subordinated Financing will be governed by definitive loan (or an indenture or
note agreement in the case of a note financing) and related agreements and
documentation (collectively, the "Financing Documentation") in form and
substance reasonably satisfactory to the Lender. The Financing Documentation
shall be prepared by Cahill Gordon & Reindel, special counsel to the Lender. The
Financing Documentation shall contain such covenants, terms and conditions as
are consistent with this letter and the Term Sheet and such other covenants,
terms, conditions, representations, warranties, events of default and remedies
provisions as shall be satisfactory to the Lender and you and which are typical
for mezzanine financings.

          Section 3. Conditions. The obligation of the Lender under Section 1 of
this letter to provide the Senior Subordinated Financing is subject to
fulfillment of the following conditions:

          (a) Acquisition Agreement. The Company and Acquisition Corp. shall
     have entered into a merger agreement or other acquisition agreement (the
     "Acquisition Agreement") on terms and in form and substance reasonably
     satisfactory to the Lender. The Acquisition Agreement shall not have been
     amended in any material respect without the Lender's consent, which consent
     shall not be unreasonably withheld. All conditions precedent to the
     Recapitalization contained in the Acquisition Agreement shall have been
     performed or complied with substantially on the terms set forth therein and
     not waived without the Lender's consent, which consent

<PAGE>

                                      -4-

     shall not be unreasonably  withheld,  and the  Recapitalization  shall have
     been consummated  simultaneously with the making of the Senior Subordinated
     Financing.

          (b) Financing Documentation. The Company and the Lender shall have
     entered into the Financing Documentation relating to the Senior
     Subordinated Financing and the transactions contemplated thereby, on terms
     and in form and substance reasonably satisfactory to the Lender.

          (c) Bank Financing. The Company shall have entered into definitive
     documentation on terms and in form and substance reasonably satisfactory to
     the Lender with respect to the Bank Financing (collectively with all
     documents and instruments related thereto or delivered in connection
     therewith, the "Bank Documents") with a commercial lender or lenders or a
     syndicate of commercial lenders in form and substance reasonably
     satisfactory to the Lender. The Bank Documents shall be in full force and
     effect and the parties thereto shall be in compliance with all material
     agreements thereunder.

          (d) Equity Financing. On or prior to the Closing Date, the Company
     shall have received cash proceeds of not less than $26.575 million from the
     Equity Financing (up to $6.275 million of which may be in the form of
     rollover equity). The terms of the Equity Financing shall be reasonably
     satisfactory to the Lender.

          (e) No Adverse Change or Development, Etc. (i) Nothing shall have
     occurred since December 31, 1998 (and the Lender shall have become aware of
     no facts or conditions not previously known to the Lender) which the Lender
     shall, in its reasonable discretion, determine could have a material
     adverse effect on the rights or remedies of the Lender, or on the ability
     of the Company to perform its obligations to the Lender or which could have
     a materially adverse effect on the business, property, assets, liabilities,
     condition (financial or otherwise), results of operations or prospects of
     the Company (a "Material Adverse Effect"); (ii) trading in securities
     generally on the New York or American Stock Exchange shall not have been
     suspended and minimum or maximum prices shall not have been established on
     any such exchange; (iii) a banking moratorium shall not have been declared
     by New York or United States authorities; and (iv) there shall not have
     been (A) an outbreak or escalation of hostilities between the United States
     and any foreign power,

<PAGE>

                                      -5-

     or (B) an outbreak or escalation of any other insurrection or armed
     conflict involving the United States or any other national or international
     calamity or emergency, or (C) any material change in the general financial
     markets of the United States which, in each case, in the reasonable
     judgment of the Lender would have a material adverse effect on the ability
     to syndicate loans or sell or place securities, as the case may be, such as
     the Senior Subordinated Financing.

          (f) Capital Structure. The pro forma consolidated capital structure of
     the Company, after giving effect to the Recapitalization, shall be
     consistent with the capital structure contemplated herein, and other than
     the Senior Subordinated Financing, the Bank Financing and other
     indebtedness reasonably satisfactory to the Lender, the Company, after
     giving effect to, and upon consummation of, the Recapitalization, shall
     have no outstanding indebtedness for money borrowed.

          (g) Opinions. As of the Closing Date, the Lender shall have received
     legal and other opinions (including all reports and certificates as to
     solvency received by the lenders under the Bank Financing) from persons,
     and covering matters, reasonably acceptable to the Lender.

          (h) Litigation. There shall exist no action, suit, investigation,
     litigation or proceeding pending or threatened in any court or before any
     arbitrator or governmental or regulatory agency or authority that could
     reasonably be expected to have a Material Adverse Effect.

          Section 4. Indemnification and Contribution. You, together with
certain of your affiliates, agree to indemnify the Lender and its affiliates and
each person in control of the Lender and its affiliates and the respective
officers, directors, employees, agents and representatives of the Lender and its
affiliates and control persons, as provided in the Indemnity Letter dated the
date hereof (the "Indemnity Letter") and attached hereto.

          Section 5. Expenses. In addition to any fees that may be payable to
the Lender hereunder and regardless of whether any of the transactions
contemplated by this letter are consummated, if this letter agreement is
terminated, the Senior Subordinated Financing is made available or the Financing
Documentation is executed and delivered, you hereby agree to reimburse the
Lender upon demand for all reasonable fees and dis-

and disbursements of Cahill Gordon & Reindel, the Lender's special counsel, and
all of the Lender's travel and other reasonable and documented out-of-pocket
expenses incurred in connection with the Transaction or otherwise arising out of
the Lender's commitment hereunder; provided that if Lender fails to fulfill its
obligations hereunder, no such fees or expenses shall be payable to the Lender.

          Section 6. Termination. The Lender's commitment hereunder to provide
the Senior Subordinated Loan shall terminate, unless expressly agreed to by the
Lender in its sole discretion to be extended to another date, on the earlier of
(A) December 15, 1999 if the Senior Subordinated Financing has not been funded
(other than as a result of failure of the Lender to fulfill its obligations
hereunder), and (B) the termination of the Acquisition Agreement in accordance
with its terms. No such termination of such commitment shall affect your
obligations under Sections 4 and 5 hereof or this Section 6, which shall survive
any such termination.

          Section 7. Assignment. This letter shall not be assignable by any
party hereto without the prior written consent of the other parties (other than,
in the case of the Lender, to an affiliate of the Lender, it being understood
that any such affiliate shall be subject to the restrictions set forth in this
Section 7); provided, however, that the Lender shall have the right, in its sole
discretion, to syndicate the Senior Subordinated Financing among banks or other
financial institutions pursuant to the Financing Documentation or otherwise and
to sell, transfer or assign all or any portion of, or interests or
participations in, the Senior Subordinated Financing and any notes issued in
connection therewith. You agree to use your reasonable best efforts, whether
prior to or after the funding date of the Senior Subordinated Financing, to
assist the Lender in syndicating the Senior Subordinated Financing or its
commitment with respect thereto, including, without limitation, in connection
with (x) the preparation of an information package regarding the Transaction,
including the Information and the Projections described in Section 1 hereof, and
(y) meetings and other communications with prospective Lenders, including making
senior management of the Company and other representatives of the Company
available (at mutually agreeable times) to participate in such meetings.

            Section 8. Miscellaneous. THIS LETTER SHALL BE GOVERNED BY, AND

               (i)  Survival  and  Notice.  Notwithstanding  Section  8.1 of the
     Merger Agreement,  for purposes of this Agreement all  representations  and
     warranties of the Company in the Merger Agreement shall survive the Closing
     Date and the consummation of the transactions contemplated hereby and shall
     not be affected by any examination  made for or on behalf of any party, the
     knowledge  of  any  of  such  party's  officers,  directors,  stockholders,
     employees,  or agents,  or the  acceptance of any  certificate  or opinion.
     Notwithstanding  the  foregoing,  with respect to the  representations  and
     warranties contained in Article 3 of the Merger Agreement,  HK shall not be
     entitled to recover for any Loss  pursuant to Section  7(b) unless  written
     notice of a claim  thereof  is  delivered  to the  Shareholders  before the
     Applicable  Limitation  Date.  For  purposes  of this  Agreement,  the term
     "Applicable  Limitation Date" shall mean March 31, 2001;  provided that the
     Applicable Limitation Date with respect to any Loss arising from or related
     to a breach of the  representations and warranties of the Company set forth
     in  Section  3.1  (Organization  and  Qualifications;   Subsidiaries),  3.2
     (Capitalization; Subsidiaries), 3.3 (Authority Relative to this Agreement),
     and 3.9 (Taxes) of the Merger  Agreement shall be the date of expiration of
     the statute of limitations  applicable to the statute,  regulation or other
     authority  which  related  to such Loss  (including  extensions  or waivers
     thereof). All statements as to factual matters contained in any certificate
     or other instrument delivered at the Closing on behalf any Shareholder, the
     Company  or its  Subsidiaries  shall be  deemed to be  representations  and
     warranties by such party hereunder as of the Closing Date.

               (ii)  Dollar  Basket.  Shareholders  shall  not be  obligated  to
     indemnify  the  Indemnities  for any single  Loss  covered by Section  7(b)
     (consolidating  into any single Loss any series of related events,  factors
     or  circumstances  giving rise to liability on the same or a  substantially
     related   basis)  unless  such  Loss  exceeds   $250,000,   in  which  case
     Shareholders  shall be obligated to indemnify the  Indemnities for the full
     amount of such Loss (subject to the other  limitations set forth in clauses
     (i) and (ii) of this Section 7(c)).

               (iii) Cap. An Indemnitee's remedy for any  indemnification  claim
     against the  Shareholders  pursuant to Section 7(b) shall be limited to and
     satisfied  solely from the Escrow;  provided  that with respect to any Loss
     arising from or related to a breach of the  representations  and warranties
     of the Company set forth in Section 3.1 (Organization  and  Qualifications;
     Subsidiaries), 3.2 (Capitalization;  Subsidiaries), 3.3 (Authority Relative
     to  this  Agreement),  and  3.9  (Taxes),  or in  the  case  of  fraud,  an
     Indemnitee's remedy for any

                                       -6-

<PAGE>

     indemnification   claim  shall  not  be  limited  to  the  Escrow  and  the
     Shareholders  will be obligated to indemnify the  Indemnitees for Losses up
     to the Merger Consideration received by the Shareholders.

          (d) Indemnification Procedures.

               (i)   Notice   of   Claim.   Any   Person   making  a  claim  for
     indemnification  pursuant to Section  7(b) above (an  "Indemnified  Party")
     must give the Party from whom  indemnification  is sought (an "Indemnifying
     Party")  written notice of such claim  describing such claim and the nature
     and amount of such Loss (to the  extent  that the nature and amount of such
     Loss is known at such time) (an  "Indemnification  Claim Notice")  promptly
     after the  Indemnified  Party  receives  any written  notice of any action,
     lawsuit, proceeding,  investigation or other claim (a "Proceeding") against
     or involving the  Indemnified  Party or otherwise  discovers the liability,
     obligation or facts giving rise to such claim for indemnification; provided
     that the failure to notify or delay in notifying an Indemnifying Party will
     not relieve the Indemnifying  Party of its obligations  pursuant to Section
     7(b),  except to the extent that (and only to the extent that) such failure
     shall have caused the damages for which the Indemnifying Party is obligated
     to be greater than such damages would have been had the  Indemnified  Party
     given the Indemnifying Party prompt notice hereunder.

               (ii) Control of Defense:  Conditions. With respect to the defense
     of any Proceeding  against or involving an  Indemnified  Party in which the
     party in  question  seeks  only the  recovery  of a sum of money  for which
     indemnification  is provided in Section 7(b), at its option an Indemnifying
     Party may  appoint  as lead  counsel  of such  defense  any  legal  counsel
     selected by the Indemnified  Party;  provided that before the  Indemnifying
     Party assumes control of such defense it must first

               (A) enter into an agreement with the  Indemnified  Party (in form
          and substance satisfactory to the Indemnified Party) pursuant to which
          the  Indemnifying  Party  agrees  to be  fully  responsible  (with  no
          reservation  of any rights other than the right to be surrogate to the
          rights of the  Indemnified  Party)  for all  Losses  relating  to such
          Proceeding and unconditionally  guarantees the payment and performance
          of any  liability or  obligation  which may arise with respect to such
          Proceeding or the facts giving rise to such claim for indemnification,
          and

               (B)  furnish  the  Indemnified   Party  with  evidence  that  the
          Indemnifying Party, in the Indemnified  Party's sole judgment,  is and
          will be able to satisfy any such liability.

               (iii) Control of Defense:  Exceptions, etc. The Indemnified Party
     will be entitled to  participate in the defense of such claim and to employ
     counsel of its choice for

                                       -7-

<PAGE>

     such  purpose  at  its  own  expense;  provided  that  notwithstanding  the
     foregoing,  the  Indemnifying  Party  will  bear  the  reasonable  fees and
     expenses of such separate counsel incurred prior to the date upon which the
     Indemnifying  Party  effectively  assumes  control  of  such  defense.  The
     Indemnifying Party will not be entitled to assume control of the defense of
     such claim,  and will pay the reasonable fees and expenses of legal counsel
     retained by the Indemnified Party, if

               (A) the  Indemnified  Party  reasonably  believes that an adverse
          determination of such Proceeding could be detrimental to or injure the
          Indemnified Party's reputation or future business prospects,

               (B) the Indemnified  Party reasonably  believes that there exists
          or  could  arise  a  conflict  of  interest  which,  under  applicable
          principles of legal ethics, could prohibit a single legal counsel from
          representing both the Indemnified Party and the Indemnifying  Party in
          such Proceeding, or

               (C) a court of competent jurisdiction rules that the Indemnifying
          Party has failed or is failing to prosecute or defend  vigorously such
          claim; and

The Indemnifying  Party must obtain the prior written consent of the Indemnified
Party (which the  Indemnified  Party will not  unreasonably  withhold)  prior to
entering  into any  settlement  of such claim or Proceeding or ceasing to defend
such claim or Proceeding.

               (iv)   Payments.   Any   payment   pursuant   to  a   claim   for
     indemnification shall be made not later than thirty (30) days after receipt
     by the  Indemnifying  Party of written  notice from the  Indemnified  Party
     stating the amount of the claim,  unless the claim is subject to defense as
     provided in Section  7(d)(v) or is otherwise  disputed by the  Indemnifying
     Party, in which case payment shall be made not later than 30 days after the
     amount  of the claim is  finally  determined  in  accordance  with  Section
     7(d)(v).  Any  payment  required  under this  Section  7(d)(iv)  shall bear
     interest  at 8% per  annum or,  if less,  the  maximum  rate  permitted  by
     applicable usury laws from the date that the Indemnified Party incurred the
     Loss for which  indemnification  is  sought.  Interest  on any such  unpaid
     amount shall be compounded monthly, computed on the basis of a 365-day year
     and shall be payable on demand. In addition, such party shall reimburse the
     other  party  for any and all  costs  or  expenses  of any  nature  or kind
     whatsoever  (including but not limited to all attorneys'  fees) incurred in
     seeking to collect such Losses.

               (v) Treatment of Indemnification  Payments. Each Party will treat
     all payments made pursuant to Section 7(b) as  adjustments  to the purchase
     price paid for the  Shareholders'  Non-Rollover  Shares (as  defined in the
     Merger  Agreement) in connection  with  consummation  of the Merger for all
     purposes.  Each Party  agrees to use  reasonable  efforts to seek  recovery
     under any  insurance  coverage  which such Party may have in respect of any

                                       -8-

<PAGE>

     Loss;  provided  that,  to the extent not  already  taken into  account,  a
     Party's Loss will include any increased  premium which results from seeking
     such recovery or the  occurrence  or existence of any fact or  circumstance
     giving rise to such Loss.

               (vi) Other  Indemnification  Provisions.  Each Shareholder hereby
     agrees  that he will not  make  any  claim  for  indemnification  hereunder
     against  the  Company  by  reason  of the fact  that he was a  shareholder,
     director,  officer, employee, or agent of the Company or was serving at the
     request of the Company as a partner, trustee, director,  officer, employee,
     or other  agent of another  entity  (whether  such claim is for  judgments,
     damages,  penalties,  fines, costs,  amounts paid in settlement,  losses or
     expenses) with respect to any action, suit, proceeding,  complaint,  claim,
     or demand brought by the Company  against such  Shareholder if such action,
     suit, proceeding, complaint, claim or demand is pursuant to this Agreement;
     it being understood that the foregoing  limitation is not intended to apply
     to any indemnification obligations owed to Shareholders with respect to any
     action,  suit,  proceeding,  complaint,  claim or demand  unrelated to this
     Agreement and the transactions contemplated hereby. Each Shareholder hereby
     acknowledges  that he will  have no  claims  or  right to  contribution  or
     indemnity from the Company with respect to amounts paid by such Shareholder
     pursuant to Section 7(b).

          (e) Arbitration Procedures.

               (i) Each Party agrees that the  arbitration  procedure  set forth
     below shall be the sole and  exclusive  method for  resolving and remedying
     claims for money damages arising out of the provisions of Section 7(b) (the
     "Disputes").  Nothing in this  Section  7(e) shall  prohibit a party hereto
     from instituting  litigation to enforce any Final Determination (as defined
     below) or availing  itself of the other  remedies set forth in Section 7(f)
     below. The Parties hereby agree and acknowledge  that,  except as otherwise
     provided in this Section 7(e) or in the Commercial Arbitration Rules of the
     American  Arbitration  Association  as in  effect  from  time to time,  the
     arbitration  procedures  and any  Final  Determination  hereunder  shall be
     governed by, and shall be enforced pursuant to the Uniform Arbitration Act,
     9 U.S.C. ss. 1 et seq.

               (ii) In the event  that any Party  asserts  that  there  exists a
     Dispute,  such Party  shall  deliver a written  notice to each other  Party
     involved  therein  specifying  the  nature  of  the  asserted  Dispute  and
     requesting a meeting to attempt to resolve the same. If no such  resolution
     is reached within ten business days after such delivery of such notice, the
     Party  delivering  such notice of Dispute  (the  "Disputing  Person")  may,
     within  30  days  after  delivery  of  such  notice,  commence  arbitration
     hereunder by  delivering to each other Party  involved  therein a notice of
     arbitration (a "Notice of Arbitration") and by filing a copy of such Notice
     of  Arbitration  with  the New  York  office  of the  American  Arbitration
     Association.  Such Notice of  Arbitration  shall  specify the matters as to
     which arbitration is sought, the nature of any Dispute,  the claims of each
     Party to the  arbitration  and shall  specify  the amount and

                                       -9-

<PAGE>

     nature of any  damages,  if any,  sought to be recovered as a result of any
     alleged claim, and any other matters required by the Commercial Arbitration
     Rules of the  American  Arbitration  Association  as in effect from time to
     time to be included therein, if any.

               (iii) The Disputing Party, on the one hand, and the other Parties
     involved  therein,  on the other hand,  each shall  select one  non-neutral
     arbitrator  expert in the subject matter of the Dispute (the arbitrators so
     selected shall be referred to herein as the "Disputing Party's  Arbitrator"
     and the "Non-Disputing  Party's  Arbitrator,"  respectively).  In the event
     that either Party fails to select an  arbitrator as set forth herein within
     ten (10) business days from the delivery of a Notice of  Arbitration,  then
     the matter shall be resolved by the arbitrator selected by the other party.
     The Disputing Party's  Arbitrator and the Non- Disputing Party's Arbitrator
     shall select a third independent,  neutral arbitrator expert in the subject
     matter of the dispute,  and the three arbitrators so selected shall resolve
     the matter  according to the  procedures set forth in this Section 7(e). If
     the Disputing Party's  Arbitrator and the Non-Disputing  Party's Arbitrator
     are unable to agree on a third  arbitrator  within  twenty  (20) days after
     their  selection,  the American  Arbitration  Association  shall select the
     third arbitrator.

               (iv) The  arbitrator(s)  selected  pursuant to  subsection  (iii)
     above  will   determine  the  allocation  of  the  costs  and  expenses  of
     arbitration  (including,  without limitation,  each Party's attorneys' fees
     and cost of  investigation)  based  upon the  ratio of the  portion  of the
     contested  amount not awarded to each Party to the amount contested by such
     Party.  For example,  if the Disputing Party submits a claim for $1,000 and
     if the other  Parties  involved  in the  Dispute  contest  only $500 of the
     amount claimed by the Disputing Party, and if the arbitrator(s)  ultimately
     resolves  the  dispute by  awarding  the  Disputing  Party $300 of the $500
     contested, then the costs and expenses of arbitration will be allocated 40%
     (i.e.,  200 / 500) to the Disputing Party and 60% (i.e.,  300 / 500) to the
     other Parties involved in the Dispute.

               (v) The  arbitration  shall be  conducted  under  the  Commercial
     Arbitration Rules of the American Arbitration Association as in effect from
     time to time,  except as  otherwise  set forth herein or as modified by the
     agreement of all of the Parties.  The arbitration shall be conducted in New
     York, New York. The  arbitrators  shall so conduct the  arbitration  that a
     final result,  determination,  finding,  judgment  and/or award (the "Final
     Determination") is made or rendered as soon as practicable, but in no event
     later than 60 days after the  delivery  of the  Notice of  Arbitration  nor
     later than 10 business days following  completion of the  arbitration.  The
     Final  Determination  must be agreed upon and signed by the sole arbitrator
     or by at least two of the three arbitrators (as the case may be). The Final
     Determination  shall be final and binding on all Parties and there shall be
     no appeal  from or  reexamination  of the Final  Determination,  except for
     fraud,   perjury,   evident  partiality  or  misconduct  by  an  arbitrator
     prejudicing  the  rights  of any  Party and to  correct  manifest  clerical
     errors.

                                      -10-

<PAGE>

               (vi) A Party may enforce any Final  Determination in any state or
     federal court having jurisdiction over the dispute.  For the purpose of any
     action or proceeding  instituted  with respect to any Final  Determination,
     each Party hereby  irrevocably  submits to the jurisdiction of such courts,
     irrevocably  consents  to the  service  of process  by  registered  mail or
     personal  service and hereby  irrevocably  waives,  to the  fullest  extent
     permitted by law, any objection  which it may have or hereafter  have as to
     personal  jurisdiction,  the  laying  of the  venue of any such  action  or
     proceeding  brought in any such court and any claim that any such action or
     proceeding brought in such court has been brought in an inconvenient forum.

               (vii)  Any party  required  to make a  payment  pursuant  to this
     Section 7(e) shall pay the party  entitled to receive  such payment  within
     three days of the delivery of the Final  Determination  to such responsible
     party.  If any  party  shall  fail to pay the  amount of  damages,  if any,
     assessed  against it within 10 days of the  delivery  to such party of such
     award, the unpaid amount shall bear interest from the date of such delivery
     at 14% per annum or, if less,  the maximum  rate  permitted  by  applicable
     usury laws. Interest on any such unpaid amount shall be compounded monthly,
     computed on the basis of a 365-day year and shall be payable on demand.  In
     addition,  such party shall reimburse the other party for any and all costs
     or expenses of any nature or kind whatsoever  (including but not limited to
     all  attorneys'  fees)  incurred in seeking to collect  such  damages or to
     enforce any such award.

          (f) Remedies.  The foregoing  indemnification  provisions shall be the
exclusive  remedy for the matters set forth in Section 7(b),  except in the case
of fraud,  in which case each  Indemnitee  shall be able to seek any  statutory,
equitable or common law remedy it may have.

     8.  Non-Competition.  As a condition  precedent to HK's obligation to enter
into and perform its obligations  under the Merger  Agreement,  each Shareholder
agrees that:

          (a) For a  period  of five (5)  years  after  the  Closing  Date  (the
"Non-Competition  Period"),  such Shareholder shall not, directly or indirectly,
either for himself or for any other person,  "participate" anywhere in the world
in the business as currently  conducted by or as proposed to be conducted by the
Company  and  its  Subsidiaries,  including  but  not  limited  to  the  design,
manufacture,  marketing,  distribution,  licensing  and sale of  children's  and
teen's (i.e. ages 0-21) apparel or accessories (the "Business"). For purposes of
this Agreement,  the term "participate" includes any direct or indirect interest
in any enterprise,  whether as an officer,  director,  employee,  partner,  sole
proprietor,   agent,   representative,   independent   contractor,   consultant,
franchisor,  franchisee,  creditor, owner or otherwise;  provided, that the term
"participate"  shall  not  include  ownership  of less than 5% of the stock of a
publicly-held  corporation  whose  stock  is  traded  on a  national  securities
exchange or in the over-the-counter market or the continued participation by the
Shareholder  on the Board of  Directors  of any company in which he serves as of
the date hereof.

                                      -11-

<PAGE>

          (b) During  the  Non-Competition  Period,  such  Shareholder  will not
divulge or appropriate  for his own use, or for the use of any third party,  any
secret or  confidential  information or knowledge  obtained by such  Shareholder
concerning  the  Business.  This  obligation  of  secrecy  shall  not  apply  to
information which (i) is or becomes part of the public domain other than through
breach  of this  Agreement  or  through  the fault of such  Shareholder  from an
unaffiliated  source,  which source has no obligation of secrecy to the Company,
(ii) is required to be  disclosed  by law or  government  order (but only to the
extent so required),  or (iii) is used by such Shareholder in any other lines of
business (but only to the extent so used).

          (c) During the  five-year  period  following  the Closing  Date,  such
Shareholder  shall not  solicit  the  employment  (in any  capacity)  of or hire
directly or through  another  entity any  employee of the Business or any person
who was an  employee  of the  Business  during the one year  period  immediately
preceding  the date of such  solicitation  or hire  without  the  prior  written
consent of the Company and Parent.

          (d) If at the time of  enforcement  of this  Section 8, a court  holds
that the duration,  scope,  geographic area or other restrictions  stated herein
are unreasonable under  circumstances then existing,  the parties agree that the
maximum duration, scope, geographic area or other restrictions deemed reasonable
under such  circumstances  by such  court  shall be  substituted  for the stated
duration, scope, geographic area or other restrictions.

          (e) Such  Shareholder  recognizes  and  affirms  that in the  event of
breach of any of the  provisions  of this  Section  8,  money  damages  would be
inadequate and the Company and its affiliates  would have no adequate  remedy at
law.  Accordingly,  such Shareholder  agrees that the Company and its affiliates
shall have the right,  in addition to any other rights and remedies  existing in
their favor, to enforce their rights and such  Shareholder's  obligations  under
this  Section 10 not only by an action or actions  for  damages,  but also by an
action or actions for specific  performance,  injunctive  and/or other equitable
relief in order to enforce  or prevent  any  violations  (whether  anticipatory,
continuing  or  future)  of the  provisions  of  Section 8  (including,  without
limitation, the extension of the Non-Competition Period by a period equal to (i)
the length of the  violation of this Section 8 plus (ii) the length of any court
proceedings  necessary  to stop  such  violation).  In the  event of a breach or
violation by such  Shareholder  of any of the  provisions  of this Section 8 the
running of the Non-Competition Period (but not of such Shareholder's obligations
under this  Section 8) shall be tolled with respect to such  Shareholder  during
the continuance of any actual breach or violation.

     9. Further  Assurances.  Each Shareholder will, from time to time,  execute
and deliver,  or cause to be executed and delivered,  such additional or further
transfers, assignments,  endorsements,  consents and other instruments as HK may
reasonably request for the purpose of effectively  carrying out the transactions
contemplated by this Agreement and to vest the power to vote such  Shareholder's
Shares as  contemplated  by  Section 3. HK agrees to use  reasonable  efforts to
take, or cause to be taken,  all actions  necessary to comply  promptly with all
legal  requirements

                                      -12-

<PAGE>

that may be  imposed  with  respect  to the  transactions  contemplated  by this
Agreement (including legal requirements of the HSR Act).

     10. Termination and Alternate  Transaction Fee. The Shareholders agree that
in the event the  Company is  required  to pay a  Termination  Fee  pursuant  to
Section  7.3 of  the  Merger  Agreement,  the  Shareholders  shall  jointly  and
severally  pay to HK $1.5  million  in cash  within  ten days of the  date  such
Termination  Fee becomes due and owing.  In addition to the above  payment,  the
Shareholders  agree  that  in  the  event  the  Company  is  required  to  pay a
Termination  Fee  pursuant  to  Section  7.3  of  the  Merger   Agreement,   the
Shareholders  shall  jointly  and  severally  pay  to HK in  cash  an  Alternate
Transaction  Fee at the  closing  of an  Alternate  Transaction.  An  "Alternate
Transaction"  shall mean a  transaction  that closes within twelve months of the
date of the termination of the Merger Agreement  wherein any of the Shareholders
sell shares in the Company to a person  other than HK or an affiliate of HK. The
"Alternative  Transaction Fee" shall mean the product of (i) 90%,  multiplied by
(ii) the  total  number  of  shares  sold by the  Shareholders  in an  Alternate
Transaction,  multiplied  by (iii)  the  excess of (a) the price per share to be
received  plus any other  consideration  to be received  in any form  (including
without  limitation  earn-out  payments,  bonus  payments,  excess  compensation
payments, etc.) by the Shareholders in an Alternate Transaction over (b) $7.164.

     11.  Assignment;  Binding  Effect.  Neither this  Agreement  nor any of the
rights,  interests  or  obligations  hereunder  shall be  assigned by any of the

parties need not sign the same counterpart.

          (g) Entire  Agreement;  No Third-Party  Beneficiaries.  This Agreement
(including the documents and instruments referred to herein) (i) constitutes the
entire  agreement and supersedes all prior agreements and  understandings,  both

     13.  Shareholder  Capacity.  No person  executing  this Agreement who is or
becomes  during the term hereof a director  or officer of the Company  makes any

unenforceable,   the   remainder  of  the  terms,   provisions,   covenants  and
restrictions  of this Agreement  shall remain in full force and effect and shall
in no way be  affected,  impaired  or  invalidated.  If any  provision  of  this

          NOW,  THEREFORE,  in consideration  of the mutual covenants  contained

                    Rosen,  Sami W.  Mnaymneh,  Anthony  A.  Tamer  and  John P.
                    Bolduc; and

                         (B) Jack M.  Benun,  Mark B.  Benun,  Isaac  Levy,  and
                    Andrew Glasgow (the "Management Directors");

                    (iii) the  removal  from the Board of any  Investment  Corp.
          Director shall be only upon the written request of Investment Corp.;

                    (iv) the removal from the Board of any Management  Director,
          other than as set forth in Section 1(a)(v) hereof,  shall be only upon
          the written request of the majority of the Management  Directors other
          than the Director to be removed;

                    (v) in the event that any Management  Director  ceases to be
          an employee of the Company and its  Subsidiaries,  he shall be removed
          as a director promptly after his employment ceases; provided, however,
          that such  Management  Director shall retain his  directorship if both
          (a) such  Management  Director was  terminated  without Cause (as such
          term is defined in such Management Director's Employment Agreement) or
          resigned with Good Reason (as such term is defined in such  Management
          Director's  Employment  Agreement),  and (b) such Management  Director
          continues  to hold five (5)  percent or more of the  Company's  Common
          Stock; and

                    (vi) in the event  that any  Investment  Corp.  Director  or
          Management  Director  designated  hereunder  for any reason  ceases to
          serve  as a  member  of the  Board  during  his  term of  office,  the
          resulting  vacancy  on the Board  shall be filled by a  representative
          designated by holders of a majority of the Investment Corp. Shares, or
          by  holders  of  a  majority  of  the  Management   Investor   Shares,
          respectively;  provided, however, that if a Management Director ceases
          to serve as a member of the Board because he was terminated with Cause
          (as such term is  defined  in such  Management  Director's  Employment
          Agreement) or resigned without Good Reason (as such term is defined in
          such Management Director's Employment  Agreement),  then the resulting
          vacancy on the Board  shall be filled by holders of a majority  of the
          Investment Corp. Shares.

          (b) The  Company  shall  pay  all  reasonable  out-of-pocket  expenses
incurred  by each  director in  connection  with  attending  regular and special

directorship  pursuant to the terms of this  Section 1, the election of a person
to such  directorship  shall be  accomplished  in accordance  with the Company's
bylaws and applicable law.

          (a) Transfer of Shareholder  Shares.  No holder of Shareholder  Shares
(other  than  Investment  Corp.  and its  Affiliates,  who  shall  only be bound
pursuant to (b) below) shall sell, transfer, assign, pledge or otherwise dispose
of (a  "Transfer")  any  interest in any  Shareholder  Shares  without the prior
written consent of the Investment  Corp.,  except  Transfers  pursuant to and in
accordance with paragraphs 2(b), 2(c), 3, 4 and 5 below.

          (b) Participation Rights.

                    (i) Except in the case of a Transfer permitted by paragraphs
          2(c)(i), (ii) or (iv) below, at least 30 days prior to any Transfer of
          Shareholder  Shares by Investment  Corp.  (other than a Transfer among
          the  shareholders  of  Investment  Corp.  or its  Affiliates  or to an
          employee of the Company or its  Subsidiaries),  Investment  Corp. (the
          "Transferring  Shareholder")  will deliver a written notice (the "Sale
          Notice") to the Company and the other  holders of  Shareholder  Shares
          (the  "Other  Shareholders"),  specifying  in  reasonable  detail  the
          identity of the prospective transferee(s) and the terms and conditions
          of the Transfer.  The Other  Shareholders  may elect to participate in
          the  contemplated   Transfer  by  delivering  written  notice  to  the
          Transferring  Shareholder  within 15 days after  delivery  of the Sale
          Notice. If any Other  Shareholders have elected to participate in such
          Transfer,   the  Trans  ferring   Shareholder   and  each  such  Other
          Shareholder will be entitled to sell in the contemplated  Transfer, at
          the same price and on the same terms, a number of  Shareholder  Shares
          equal to the product of (A) the  quotient  determined  by dividing the
          number of  Shareholder  Shares  owned by such Person by the  aggregate
          number of Shareholder Shares owned by the Transferring Shareholder and
          the Other  Shareholders  participating  in such sale and the aggregate
          number of Shareholder Shares held by any other Shareholders exercising
          any  contractual  rights they may have to participate in such sale and
          proposed  to be sold in such  sale and (B) the  number  of  shares  of
          Shareholder Shares to be sold in the contemplated Transfer.

                    (ii)  The  Transferring   Shareholder  will  use  reasonable
          efforts to obtain the agreement of the  prospective  transferee(s)  to
          the  participation  of the  Other  Shareholders  in  any  contemplated
          Transfer,  and the  Transferring  Shareholder will not Transfer any of
          its Shareholder Shares to the prospective transferee(s) unless (A) the
          prospective  transferee(s)  agrees to allow the  participation  of the
          Other  Shareholders  or (B) the  Transferring  Shareholder  agrees  to
          purchase the number of shares of such class of Shareholder Shares from
          the Other  Shareholders  which the Other  Shareholders would have been
          entitled to sell  pursuant to the last  sentence of paragraph  2(b)(i)
          above.

(c) Permitted Transfers.  The restrictions  contained in paragraphs 2(a) and (b)
shall not apply to (i) any Transfer of  Shareholder  Shares by Investment  Corp.
among its  Affiliates,  (ii) a Public  Sale,  (iii) an  Approved  Sale or (iv) a
Transfer  of  Shareholder  Shares  by any  Shareholder  pursuant  to the laws of
descent and distribution or among such Shareholder's Family Group; provided that
the  restrictions  contained in this Agreement will continue to be applicable to
the Shareholder

Shares  after  any  Transfer  pursuant  to  clauses  (i) and (iv)  above and the
transferees of such Shareholder Shares shall agree in writing to be bound by the
provisions of this Agreement.  Upon the Transfer of Shareholder  Shares pursuant
to this  paragraph  2(c), the  transferees  will deliver a written notice to the
Company and Investment  Corp.,  which notice will disclose in reasonable  detail
the identity of such transferee.

          (d) Termination of  Restrictions.  The  restrictions set forth in this
paragraph 2 shall  continue  with  respect to each  Shareholder  Share until the
earlier of (i) the date on which such Shareholder  Share has been transferred in
a  Public  Sale,  (ii)  the  consummation  of an  Approved  Sale  or  (iii)  the
consummation of the Company's  initial public offering of its equity  securities
(the "IPO").

          3. Repurchase Option.

          (a) In the event a  Management  Investor  ceases to be employed by the
Company and its  Subsidiaries  other than by termination  without Cause (as such
term  is  defined  in  such  Management   Director's  Employment  Agreement)  or
resignation  with  Good  Reason  (as such  term is  defined  in such  Management
Director's Employment Agreement) (the "Termination"), the Common Stock issued or

transferees) shall be subject to repurchase by Investment Corp.  pursuant to the
terms and conditions set forth in this paragraph 3 (the "Repurchase Option").

          (b) In the event a  Management  Investor  ceases to be employed by the
Company and its  Subsidiaries  because of his or her death or  disability,  such
Management  Investor  (or his  estate,  as the  case  may be) may  transfer  his
Management Investor Shares to the other Management Investors.  In the event that
any such  Management  Investor  Shares are not so transferred  within sixty (60)
days of the Management  Investor's  death or disability (as such term is defined
in such  Management  Director's  Employment  Agreement),  such  shares  shall be
subject to  repurchase  by  Investment  Corp,  and the  purchase  price for each
Management Investor Share shall be the Fair Market Value for such share.

          (c) In the event a  Management  Investor  ceases to be employed by the
Company and its  Subsidiaries  because of his or her termination  with Cause (as
such term is defined in such  Management  Director's  Employment  Agreement)  or
resignation  without  Good  Reason (as such term is  defined in such  Management
Director's  Employment  Agreement),  the  purchase  price  for  each  Management
Investor Share shall be the Original Value for such share.

(d) Investment  Corp. may elect to purchase all or any portion of the terminated
Management  Investor  Shares (other than those  transferred  pursuant to section
3(b)) by delivering  written notice (the  "Repurchase  Notice") to the holder or

Termination.  The  Repurchase  Notice  shall set forth the number of  Management
Investor  Shares to be acquired  from each holder of the  terminated  Management

shall  first  be  satisfied  to the  extent  possible  from  the  shares  of the
terminated  Management  Investor  Shares  held  by  such  terminated  Management
Investor  at the time of  delivery of the  Repurchase  Notice.  If the number of
Management  Investor Shares then held by such terminated  Management Investor is
less than the total number of Management  Investor Shares  Investment  Corp. has
elected to  purchase,  Investment  Corp.  shall  purchase the  remaining  shares
elected  to be  purchased  from the  transferee(s),  if any,  of the  terminated
Management  Investor  Shares  under this  Agreement,  pro rata  according to the
number of terminated  Management  Investor Shares held by such  transferee(s) at
the  time  of  delivery  of such  Repurchase  Notice  (determined  as  close  as
practicable to the nearest whole shares).

          (e) If for any reason  Investment Corp. does not elect to purchase all
of the Management Investor Shares pursuant to the Repurchase Option, the Company
shall be entitled to exercise the Repurchase Option for the Management  Investor
Shares Investment Corp. has not elected to purchase (the "Available Shares"). As
soon as practicable  after  Investment  Corp. has determined  that there will be
Available  Shares,  but in any  event  within  45 days  after  the  Termination,
Investment  Corp. shall give written notice (the "Option Notice") to the Company
setting  forth the number of  Available  Shares and the  purchase  price for the
Available Shares.  The Company may elect to purchase any or all of the Available
Shares  by  giving  written  notice  to  Investment  Corp.  and  the  terminated
Management  Investor  within 30 days after the  Option  Notice has been given by
Investment Corp. As soon as practicable,  and in any event within ten days after
the  expiration of the 30-day  period set forth above,  Investment  Corp.  shall
notify  each  holder of  Management  Investor  Shares as to the number of shares
being  purchased from such holder by the Company (the  "Supplemental  Repurchase
Notice").

          (f) The closing of the  purchase  of the  Management  Investor  Shares
pursuant to the  Repurchase  Option shall take place on the date  designated  by
Investment  Corp. in the Repurchase  Notice or Supplemental  Repurchase  Notice,
which  date  shall not be more  than 40 days nor less  than five days  after the
delivery of the later of either such notice to be  delivered.  Investment  Corp.
and/or the Company shall pay for the Management  Investor Shares to be purchased
pursuant to the  Repurchase  Option by  delivery of a check or wire  transfer of
funds, unless such payment violates any restrictive  covenant relating to any of
the  Company's  indebtedness,  in which case,  by a  subordinated  note or notes
payable  in up to,  three  equal  annual  installments  beginning  on the  first
anniversary  of the  closing of such  purchase  and  bearing  interest  (payable
quarterly) at a rate per annum equal to the prime rate as published from time to
time in the Wall Street Journal,  in the aggregate  amount of the purchase price
for such  shares;  provided  that  Investment  Corp.  and the Company  shall use
reasonable efforts to make all such repurchases with a check or wire transfer of
funds.  Any notes issued by the Company pursuant to this paragraph 3(f) shall be
subject to any restrictive covenants to which the Company is subject at the time
of such purchase, provided that the notes will be permitted to be paid when due.
In  addition,  the  Company  may pay the  purchase  price  for  such  shares  by
offsetting any bona fide debts owed by such Management  Investor to the Company.
The  purchasers of Management  Investor  Shares  hereunder  shall be entitled to
receive customary representations and warranties from the sellers regarding such
sale of shares (including representations and warranties regarding good title to
such  shares,  free and clear of any liens or  encumbrances)  and to require all
sellers'  signatures be  guaranteed  by a national bank or reputable  securities
broker.

          (g) The  right of  Investment  Corp.  and the  Company  to  repurchase
Management Investor Shares pursuant to this paragraph 3 shall terminate upon the
first  to  occur  of (i) the  consummation  of an  Approved  Sale  or  (ii)  the
consummation of an IPO.

          4. Sale of the Company.

          (a)  In  the  event  that  the  Board   determines   to  sell  all  or
substantially all of the Company's assets determined on a consolidated  basis or
sell  all or  substantially  all  of the  Company's  outstanding  capital  stock
(whether by merger, recapitalization, consolidation, reorganization, combination
or  otherwise),  each  holder of  Management  Investor  Shares will be given the
opportunity   to   participate   in  such  sale  process  (to  the  extent  such
participation does not materially  interfere or impede such sale process) and to
make an offer to the  Board to  purchase  such  assets or  capital  stock if the
holders of Management Investor Shares so desire.

          (b) If the Board and the holders of a majority of the shares of Common
Stock  then  outstanding  approve  a sale  of all  or  substantially  all of the
Company's  assets  determined  on a  consolidated  basis  or a  sale  of  all or
substantially all of the Company's outstanding capital stock (whether by merger,
recapitalization,  consolidation,  reorganization,  combination or otherwise) to
any Independent Third Party or group of Independent Third Parties  (collectively
an "Approved Sale"), each holder of Shareholder Shares will consent to and raise
no objections  against such Approved Sale. If the Approved Sale is structured as
(i) a merger or consolidation,  each holder of Shareholder Shares will waive any
dissenters'  rights,  appraisal rights or similar rights in connection with such
merger or consolidation or (ii) sale of stock, each holder of Shareholder Shares
will  agree  to  sell  all of his  Shareholder  Shares  and  rights  to  acquire
Shareholder  Shares on the terms and  conditions  approved  by the Board and the
holders of a majority of the Shareholder Shares then outstanding. Each holder of
Shareholder  Shares will take all  necessary or desirable  actions in connection
with the consummation of the Approved Sale as requested by the Company.

          (c) The obligations of the holders of Shareholder  Shares with respect
to an Approved Sale are subject to the satisfaction of the following conditions:
(i) upon the  consummation  of the  Approved  Sale,  each holder of  Shareholder
Shares will receive the same form of  consideration  and the same portion of the
aggregate  consideration  that such  holders of  Shareholder  Shares  would have
received if such aggregate  consideration had been distributed by the Company in
complete  liquidation  pursuant to the rights and  preferences  set forth in the
Company's  Certificate of Incorporation as in effect  immediately  prior to such
Approved Sale; (ii) if any holders of a class of Shareholder Shares are given an
option as to the form and amount of consideration to be received, each holder of
such class of Shareholder  Shares will be given the same option;  and (iii) each
holder of then  currently  exercisable  rights to  acquire  shares of a class of
Shareholder Shares will be given an opportunity to exercise such rights prior to
the consummation of the Approved Sale and participate in such sale as holders of
such class of Shareholder Shares.

          (d) If the Company or the holders of the  Company's  securities  enter
into any negotiation or transaction for which Rule 506 (or any similar rule then
in effect)  promulgated by the Securities  Exchange  Commission may be available
with  respect  to  such   negotiation  or   transaction



                                      - 6 -

(including  a merger,  consolidation  or other  reorganization),  the holders of
Shareholder  Shares  will,  at the request of the  Company,  appoint a purchaser
representative  (as such term is defined in Rule 501)  reasonably  acceptable to
the  Company.   If  any  holder  of  Shareholder  Shares  appoints  a  purchaser
representative  designated by the Company, the Company will pay the fees of such
purchaser  representative,  but if any holder of Shareholder  Shares declines to
appoint the purchaser representative  designated by the Company such holder will
appoint another  purchaser  representative,  and such holder will be responsible
for the fees of the purchaser representative so appointed.

          (e)  Holders of  Shareholder  Shares  will bear their  pro-rata  share
(based upon the number of shares  sold) of the costs of any sale of  Shareholder
Shares  pursuant to an Approved  Sale to the extent such costs are  incurred for
the benefit of all  holders of Common  Stock and are not  otherwise  paid by the
Company or the acquiring party.  Costs incurred by holders of Shareholder Shares
on their own behalf will not be considered costs of the transaction hereunder.

          (f) The provisions of this paragraph 4 will terminate upon  completion
of an IPO.

          5. Public  Offering.  If the Board of Directors of the Company and the
holders of a majority of the shares of Common Stock then outstanding  approve an
IPO pursuant to an effective  registration  statement  under the Securities Act,
the holders of Shareholder  Shares will take all necessary or desirable  actions
in connection with the consummation of the IPO; provided, however, that all such
holders of Shareholder Shares are treated on a substantially similar basis.

          6. Preemptive Rights.

          (a) If the  Company  authorizes  the  issuance  or  sale of any of its
equity securities  (other than as a dividend on the outstanding  Common Stock or
pursuant to a public offering registered under the Securities Act) to Investment
Corp. or its Affiliates, the Company shall first offer to sell to each holder of
Shareholder  Shares a portion of such stock or securities  equal to the quotient
determined by dividing (A) the number of outstanding  Shareholder Shares held by
such holder of Shareholder  Shares by (B) the total number of Shareholder Shares
outstanding.  Each holder of  Shareholder  Shares  shall be entitled to purchase
such stock or securities at the most  favorable  price and on the most favorable
terms as such stock or securities  are to be offered to Investment  Corp. or its
Affiliates.  The  purchase  price for all stock and  securities  offered to each
holder of  Shareholder  Shares  shall be  payable  in cash by wire  transfer  of
immediately available funds.

          (b) In order to exercise its purchase rights hereunder, each holder of
Shareholder  Shares must within 15 days after receipt of written notice from the
Company  describing in reason able detail the stock or securities being offered,
the purchase  price  thereof,  the payment  terms and such  holder's  percentage
allotment  deliver  a written  notice to the  Company  describing  its  election
hereunder.

          (c) Upon the expiration of the offering  periods  described above, the
Company shall be entitled to sell such stock or  securities  which the holder of
Shareholder Shares has not elected to purchase during the 90 days following such
expiration on terms and conditions no more


                                      - 7 -


<PAGE>



favorable to the purchasers thereof than those offered to holders of Shareholder
Shares.  Any stock or  securities  offered or sold by the  Company to any Person
after such 90-day period must be reoffered to each holder of Shareholder  Shares
pursuant to the terms of this paragraph 6.

          (d)  The  rights  under  this  paragraph   shall  terminate  upon  the
consummation of an IPO.

          7. Legend.  Each certificate  evidencing  Shareholder  Shares and each
certificate  issued in  exchange  for or upon the  transfer  of any  Shareholder
Shares (if such shares remain  Shareholder  Shares as defined  herein after such
Transfer) shall be stamped or otherwise imprinted with a legend in substantially
the following form:

          "THE  SECURITIES  REPRESENTED BY THIS  CERTIFICATE
          ARE  SUBJECT  TO  CERTAIN  TRANSFER   RESTRICTIONS
          PURSUANT TO A SHAREHOLDERS AGREEMENT,  DATED AS OF

          SHAREHOLDERS  AGREEMENT WILL BE FURNISHED  WITHOUT
          CHARGE BY THE  COMPANY TO THE HOLDER  HEREOF  UPON
          WRITTEN REQUEST."

The Company shall  imprint such legend on  certificates  evidencing  Shareholder
Shares outstanding prior to the date hereof. The legend set forth above shall be
removed  from  the  certificates   evidencing  any  shares  which  cease  to  be
Shareholder Shares in accordance with paragraph 11 hereof.

          8. Transfer. Prior to a Transfer of any Shareholder Shares (other than
in a  Public  Sale or in an  Approved  Sale)  to any  Person,  the  transferring
Shareholder shall cause the prospective transferee to execute and deliver to the
Company and the other Shareholders a counterpart of this Agreement.

9. Indemnification.  The Company shall indemnify,  defend and hold harmless Jack
M. Benun,  Mark J. Benun and Isaac Levy against all  judgments,  fines,  losses,
claims,  damages,  costs or expenses (including  reasonable  attorneys' fees) or
liabilities, incurred in their capacity as a shareholder of the Company, arising
out of or  related  to  matters,  actions or  omissions  or  alleged  actions or
omissions occurring or arising in connection with the transactions  contemplated
by the Merger, to the full extent permitted by New York law.

          10.  Termination  or  Amendment  of  Other  Agreements.   The  parties
acknowledge and agree that the  Shareholders  Agreement,  by and between Jack M.
Benun,  Mark J. Benun and Isaac Levy,  dated January 1, 1998 shall be terminated
and of no further force or effect, and the Voting Agreement, by and between Jack
M.  Benun,  Mark J. Benun and the  Company,  dated  January  1,  1998,  shall be
amended, as necessary, to reflect the transaction contemplated by the Merger.

Association.  The costs of said  arbitrators and the arbitration  shall be borne
equally by the parties to the arbitration.  Each party shall bear separately the
cost of their  respective  attorneys,  witnesses and experts in connection  with
such arbitration.  Time is of the essence of this arbitration procedure, and the
arbitrators shall be instructed and required to render their decision within ten
(10) days following completion of the arbitration.

          (c) Venue and  Jurisdiction.  Any and all legal proceedings to enforce
