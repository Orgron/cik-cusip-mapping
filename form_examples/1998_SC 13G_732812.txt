                              Schedule 13G
               Under the Securities Exchange Act of 1934


Amendment No. 1

Item 1(a)   Name of Issuer:
       Administaff, Inc.

Item 1(b)   Address of Issuer's Principal Executive Offices:
       19001 Crescent Spring Drive
       Kingwood, TX  77339

Item 2(a)   Name of Person(s) Filing:
       The Capital Group Companies, Inc.

Item 2(b)   Address of Principal Business Office:
       333 South Hope Street
       Los Angeles, CA  90071

Item 2(c)   Citizenship:   N/A

Item 2(d)   Title of Class of Securities:
       Common Stock

Item 2(e)   CUSIP Number:
       007094105

Item 3   The person(s) filing is(are):

       (g)   [X]   Parent Holding Company in accordance with Section
            240.13d-1(b)(1)(ii)(G).

Item 4   Ownership

       Please note that this filing is not meant to reflect any change
       in the beneficial ownership of the securities being reported
       herein by the investment management affiliates of The Capital
       Group Companies, Inc. ("CGC").

       This filing reflects the fact that CGC will no longer report the
       beneficial ownership of securities held in accounts which are
       under the discretionary investment management of its investment
       management affiliates.  The Securities and Exchange Commission
       ("SEC") recently provided guidance on when beneficial ownership
       under Rule 13d-1 should be attributed among entities under common
       control.  (See SEC Release 34-39538.)  The guidance clarifies
       that in circumstances where the organizational structure of a
       parent company and related entities is such that they exercise
       investment and voting powers independently, attribution among
       entities will not be required.  Since CGC is a holding company
       and is not involved in investment and voting decisions,
       securities beneficially owned by clients of its affiliates will
       no longer be attributed to CGC.

Item 5   Ownership of 5% or Less of a Class: [X]

Item 6   Ownership of More than 5% on Behalf of Another Person: N/A

       Company: N/A

Item 8   Identification and Classification of Members of the Group:  N/A

Item 9   Notice of Dissolution of the Group:  N/A

Item 10   Certification

       By signing below, I certify that, to the best of my knowledge and
       belief, the securities referred to above were acquired in the
       ordinary course of business and were not acquired for the purpose
       of and do not have the effect of changing or influencing the
       control of the issuer of such securities and were not acquired in
       connection with or as a participant in any transaction having
       such purpose or effect.

   Signature

       After reasonable inquiry and to the best of my knowledge and
       belief, I certify that the information set forth in this
       statement is true, complete and correct.
