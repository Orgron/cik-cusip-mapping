Item 3.   Source and Amount of Funds of Other Consideration.

Item 4.   Purpose of Transaction.

     On April 15, 1994, the Issuer entered into a Merger
Agreement (the "Merger Agreement") with Bank of Montreal
("BMO") and Harris Bankmont, Inc., a subsidiary of BMO. 
Pursuant to the Merger Agreement, the Issuer will be merged
with and into HBI and HBI will continue as the surviving
corporation (the "Merger").  Pursuant to the Merger, each
share of the Issuer's Class A and Class B Common Stock, each
$1.00 par value per share, shall be converted into the right
to receive BMO common stock, no par value, pursuant to a
formula as specified in the Merger Agreement. 

     In connection with the Merger Agreement, the Reporting
Persons entered into a voting agreement with BMO on April 15,
1994, pursuant to which the Reporting Persons, who own in the
aggregate more than a majority of the voting power of the
Issuer both individually and as trustees of certain family
trusts, agreed to vote their shares of Class A and Class B
Common Stock in favor of the Merger Agreement, among other
things (the "Voting Agreement").

     Except as described above or in Item 6 herein, the
Reporting Persons have no plans or proposals that would relate
to or result in any of the events set forth in Item 4(a)
through (j) of Schedule 13D.

     The specific terms of the Merger and the Voting Agreement
are more fully described in the Merger Agreement and the
Voting Agreement filed on April 18, 1994 as exhibits to the
Issuer's Current Report on Form 8-K and incorporated herein by
reference (the "Form 8-K").

Gerald F. Fitzgerald    Purchase    3/22/94   7,000 Class A    $41.50

</TABLE>

     The purchases on March 22, 1994 and March 29, 1994
reflected above were executed pursuant to an order placed on
behalf of Mr. Fitzgerald on March 21, 1994 to purchase 10,000
shares of Class A Common Stock at a price not to exceed $41.50
per share.  The March 21, 1994 order was placed two days prior
to the date on which representatives of Harris Bankorp first
proposed a price and general structure for a transaction which
ultimately resulted in the Merger Agreement that was reached
on April 15, 1994.  On or about April 7, 1994, Mr. Fitzgerald
gave instructions to rescind the March 22 and March 29 trades. 
Because rescission at that time was not possible, however, the
9,000 share position was sold on April 7, 1994 at a loss, as
indicated above, pursuant to Mr. Fitzgerald's instruction.

<PAGE> 20



     Set forth below is a description of selected provisions
of the Voting Agreement.

     The Voting Agreement provides that the Reporting Persons,
both individually and as trustee of certain family trusts
(referred to in this Item 6 as the "Stockholders"), in
consideration of the substantial expenses incurred and to be
incurred by BMO in connection with the Merger Agreement, shall
vote or cause to be voted or express a written consent with
respect to all of such Stockholders' shares:

          (a)  in favor of adoption and approval of the Merger
     Agreement and the Merger at every meeting of the
     stockholders of the Issuer at which such matters are
     considered and at every adjournment thereof and in
     connection with every proposal to take action by written
     consent with respect thereto; and

          (b)  against any other Acquisition Proposal (as such
     term is defined in the Merger Agreement) at every meeting
     of the stockholders of the Issuer at which such matters
     are considered and at every adjournment thereof and in
     connection with every proposal to take action by written
     consent with respect thereto.

     In the event that (i) the Merger Agreement is amended
after the date thereof to increase the Per Share Stock
Consideration (as such term is defined in the Voting
Agreement) or (ii) the Merger Agreement is terminated by the
Issuer pursuant to Section 9.2(a)(iv)(C) thereof and within
eighteen months thereafter the Issuer enters into a business
combination or other transaction with a third party pursuant
to which the Stockholders receive consideration having a value
of more than $75 per share, then BMO shall have the right to
require each Stockholder to pay BMO, in cash (unless otherwise
agreed by BMO), within two business days following the
consummation of the Merger or such business combination or
other transaction, an amount equal to the product of (A) in
the case of an event described in clause (i) above, the number
of shares owned by such Stockholder immediately prior to
consummation of the Merger or, in the case of an event
described in clause (ii) above, the number of shares owned by
such Stockholder on the date the Merger Agreement is
terminated and (B) the amount (if any) by which the value per
share actually received by the Stockholder in connection with
the Merger or such business transaction or other transaction,
as the case may be, exceeds $75.

     The Voting Agreement further provides for the following:

     1.   Each of the Stockholders will not, nor will such
Stockholder permit any entity under such Stockholder's control
to, deposit any of such Stockholder's shares in a voting trust
or subject any of their shares to any agreement, arrangement 

<PAGE>
<PAGE> 21


or understanding with respect to the voting of such shares
inconsistent with the Voting Agreement.

     2.   During the term of the Voting Agreement, each
Stockholder will not sell, assign, transfer or dispose of such
Stockholder's shares except for up to an aggregate of 75,000
shares by all Stockholders; provided, however, the foregoing
shall not preclude the pledge of any Stockholder's shares so
long as such Stockholder retains all voting rights with
respect thereto.

     The Voting Agreement terminates upon the earlier of (i)
the Effective Time (as such term is defined in the Merger
Agreement) of the Merger and (ii) the date on which the Merger
Agreement is terminated in accordance with its terms.  Upon
such termination, no party shall have any further obligations
or liabilities under the Voting Agreement; provided that such
termination shall not relieve any party from liability for any
breach of the Voting Agreement prior to such termination.

     The foregoing summary of the terms of the Voting
Agreement does not purport to be complete and is qualified in
its entirety by reference to the full text of the Voting
Agreement, a copy of which is attached as an exhibit to the
Form 8-K.
