     Item 4.   Purpose of Transaction

          Item 4, as previously amended, remains unchanged,
except that the following information is hereby added
thereto:

          Prior to the scheduled date of the Annual Meeting,
the Committee commenced litigation in Delaware Federal Court
seeking to enjoin the Annual Meeting based on the Company's
alleged violations of the Federal securities laws. 
Following a hearing held on January 27, 1997, the Court
issued an order that the polls for the Annual Meeting be
held open for two weeks following the scheduled date of the
Meeting.  The Annual Meeting was held on January 28, 1997,
and the polls closed on February 11, 1997 on which date the
January 28, 1997 meeting was reconvened.  As a result of the
stockholder vote thereof, Company management's slate of
director nominees were elected to the Company's Board of
Directors.

          On February 3, 1997, Robert Kecseg redemanded a
stockholders' list and related materials from the Company
and filed a written consent in respect of the removal of the
Company's current Board members and their replacement with
the Committee's five-person slate, thereby setting a new
record date of February 3, 1997 for its continuing consent
solicitation.  The Committee is currently contemplating
whether to actively conduct such solicitation.  The Company
did not timely comply under Delaware law with the
Committee's demand for a stockholders' list.

     Item 5.   Interest in Securities of the Issuer

          (a)  The aggregate percentage of shares of Common
Stock reported owned by each person herein is based upon

ending December 31, 1996, filed with the Securities and

the last five years, been convicted in a criminal proceeding
(excluding traffic violations or similar misdemeanors).  In
addition, none of such persons has, during the last five
years, been a party to a civil proceeding of a judicial or

result of such proceeding was or is subject to a judgment,
decree or final order enjoining future violations of, or
prohibiting or mandating activities subject to, federal or
state securities laws or finding any violation with respect
to such laws.

          (c)  Robert Myer sold an aggregate of 7,800
shares of Common Stock with respect to which he shared
voting and dispositive power with Mr. Kecseg on February 18,
1997, for an aggregate price of $21,150.  

          (d)  No person other than each respective owner of
