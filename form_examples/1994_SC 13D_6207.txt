                         SHARE PURCHASE AGREEMENT

          This Share Purchase Agreement ("Agreement") is made and
entered into on the 21st day of January, 1994, by and between
Nick G. Karabots, a resident of Pennsylvania ("Karabots"), and
Peter B. Bedford, a resident of California ("Bedford"), with
reference to the following background:

          A.  Bedford is the owner of 1,196,320 shares (the
"Shares") of the Common Stock, par value $.10 per share, of AMREP
Corporation, an Oklahoma corporation ("AMREP").

          B.  Bedford wishes to sell the Shares to Karabots for
$10.00 per share or a total purchase price of $11,963,200, and
Karabots wishes to purchase the Shares for such purchase price.

          NOW, THEREFORE, intending to be legally bound, the
parties agree as follows:

                           ARTICLE I - The Sale

          1.1  The Sale.  At a closing (the "Closing") to be held
at the offices of Greene, Radovsky, Maloney & Share, Suite 4200,
Spear Street Tower, One Market Plaza, San Francisco, California,
on February 14, 1994, or if the condition specified in Sections
3.1(d) and 3.2(b) hereof shall not then have been satisfied, then
as promptly as practicable after the date on which such condition
shall have been satisfied, but in no event later than ten days
after such condition shall have been satisfied, or at such other
place or on such other date as the parties hereto shall mutually
agree (the "Closing Date"), Bedford shall sell to Karabots, and
Karabots shall purchase from Bedford, the Shares for a price per
share of $10.00, or an aggregate purchase price of $11,963,200
(the "Purchase Price"), payable in accordance with Section 1.2
hereof.

          1.2  Payment of Purchase Price and Delivery of Shares. 
At the Closing, Bedford shall deliver to Karabots the
certificates representing the Shares free and clear of all
pledges, liens, encumbrances, claims and other charges of any
kind (including, without limitation, any agreements,
subscriptions, options, warrants, calls, commitments or rights of
any character granting to any person any interest in or right to
acquire from Bedford at any time or upon the happening of any
stated event, any of the Shares) (collectively, "Encumbrances")
other than the rights of Karabots pursuant to this Agreement, and
duly endorsed in blank or with separate stock powers attached
thereto and executed in blank (in each case, with all signatures
medallion guaranteed by a financial institution that is a member
of The Securities Transfer Association Medallion Program, New
York Stock Exchange Medallion Program or Stock Exchange Medallion
Program), in exchange for the delivery by Karabots to Bedford of
the Purchase Price by wire transfer of federal funds to such bank
account as shall be specified in a written notice from Bedford
delivered to Karabots not less than three business days prior to
the Closing Date.

          1.3  Equitable Remedies.  Bedford acknowledges that the
Shares are unique and otherwise not available and agrees that in
addition to any other remedies, Karabots may invoke any equitable
remedies to enforce delivery of the Shares hereunder, including,
without limitation, an action or suit for specific performance.

                ARTICLE II - Representations and Warranties

          2.1  Representations and Warranties of Bedford. 
Bedford hereby represents and warrants to Karabots as follows:

               (a)  Ownership of the Shares.  Bedford is the
     lawful owner, beneficially and of record, of the Shares.  On
     the date hereof, the Shares are free and clear of all
     Encumbrances except for the liens existing pursuant to a
     pledge agreement in favor of Kemper Investors Life Insurance
     Company and another pledge agreement in favor of FKLA Realty
     Corporation, as agent for a group of lenders (collectively,
     the "Liens") and the rights of Karabots pursuant to this
     Agreement.  On the Closing Date, the Liens will have been
     removed and the Shares will be free and clear of all
     Encumbrances except for the rights of Karabots pursuant to
     this Agreement.  The Shares constitute all of the shares of
     capital stock of AMREP owned, beneficially or of record, by
     Bedford.  

               (b)  Authority Relative to this Agreement. 
     Bedford has the power to execute, deliver and perform this
     Agreement and to carry out his obligations hereunder. 
     Bedford is not subject to or obligated under any contract
     provision or other agreement, or subject to any order,
     decree, law, rule or regulation, which would be violated by
     his executing and carrying out this Agreement and selling
     the Shares to Karabots as provided herein.  No
     authorization, consent or approval of any third party is
     necessary for the consummation by him of the transactions
     contemplated hereby, except for the authorization and
     consent of Kemper Investors Life Insurance Company and FKLA
     Realty Corporation, as agent for a group of lenders, with
     respect to the removal of the Liens, which will have been
     obtained prior to the Closing Date.

               (c)  Status of Shares.  All of the Shares were
     purchased by Bedford in open market purchases consummated
     between November 27, 1989 and November 9, 1990, upon the
     terms and conditions set forth on the Schedule 13D (as
     amended by Amendment Nos. 1-6 thereto) filed by Bedford with
     the Securities and Exchange Commission.  None of the
     certificates representing the Shares contains any
     restrictive legends or is subject to any restriction on
     transfer, except for any restrictions that may arise under
     the federal securities laws.

               (d)  Status and Knowledge of Bedford.  Bedford is
     not a director or officer of AMREP.  With Karabots'
     permission, no representation is made as to Bedford's status
     as an affiliate (as defined in Rule 144 promulgated under
     the Securities Act of 1933, as amended) of AMREP.  Bedford
     has no knowledge of any material information that is
     inconsistent with the information regarding AMREP that is
     publicly available.

          2.2  Representations and Warranties of Karabots. 
Karabots hereby represents and warrants to Bedford as follows:

               (a)  Authority Relative to this Agreement. 
     Karabots has the power and authority to execute, deliver and
     perform this Agreement and to carry out his obligations
     hereunder.  Karabots is not subject to or obligated under
     any contract provision or other agreement, or subject to any
     order, decree, law, rule or regulation, which would be
     violated by his executing and carrying out this Agreement. 
     No authorization, consent or approval of any third party is
     necessary for the consummation by him of the transactions
     contemplated hereby, except for filings pursuant to the
     Hart-Scott-Rodino Antitrust Improvements Act of 1976 and the
     rules and regulations thereunder (the "H-S-R Act") (and
     Karabots shall use his best efforts to make all required
     H-S-R Act filings as promptly as practicable and shall
     request early termination of all applicable waiting periods
     thereunder).

               (b)  Status and Knowledge of Karabots.  Karabots
     is a director and shareholder of AMREP and is generally
     familiar with the financial condition, business and
     prospects of AMREP.  Karabots acknowledges that he has all
     the information he considers necessary or appropriate for
     deciding whether to purchase the Shares.  Karabots has no
     knowledge of any material information that is inconsistent
     with the information regarding AMREP that is publicly
     available.

               (c)  Investment Intent.  Karabots is purchasing
     the Shares for investment and not with a view to the
     distribution thereof.

          2.3  Survival of Representations.  All of the
representations and warranties of each party shall survive the
Closing and, notwithstanding any investigation conducted before
or after the Closing or the decision of either party to complete
the Closing, the parties hereto shall be entitled to rely upon
the representations and warranties set forth herein.
