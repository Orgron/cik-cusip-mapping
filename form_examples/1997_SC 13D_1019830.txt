                                  Schedule 13D

                 The  484,296 shares are held by the Issuer's Employees' Stock
                 Ownership Plan at December 31, 1996, which shares are voted at
                 the direction of the employee participants, and of which Plan
                 the reporting person is one of three trustees.

                 At December 31, 1996 there were 9,033,585 shares of Common
                 Stock, Par Value $10.00 Per Share, issued and outstanding.

         (b)     sole power to vote or to direct the vote:   4,740

                 shared power to vote or to direct the vote:   484,296

                 sole power to dispose or to direct the disposition
                 of:   4,740

                 shared power to dispose or to direct the disposition
                 of:  484,296

         There are 484,296 allocated and unallocated shares in the Employees'
         Stock Ownership Plan ("Plan") included in the 489,036 shares mentioned
         above. The reporting person, Yvan Dupuy, has been a trustee of the Plan
         since April 18, 1996. The Plan became a reporting person on December 
         31, 1990 and first filed a Schedule 13G on February 14, 1991. 
         Amendments of Schedule 13G have been filed annually. The proxy
         statements of Benjamin Moore & Co. for its Annual Meetings of
         Shareholders in each year from 1983 to and including 1996 have reported
         the names of the trustees of the Plan, and the number of shares held by
         the Plan. Each of the Issuer's employees and former employees who is a
         participant in the Plan is entitled to instruct the trustees of the
         Plan (currently Benjamin M. Belcher, Jr., Yvan Dupuy and Richard Roob)
         as to how to vote the shares allocated to the account of such person.
         Under the Plan the trustees vote securities for which they have not
         received voting instruction from the participant and securities not
         allocated to any participant's account in the same manner and
         proportion as the voting of securities of participants who gave timely 
         voting instructions.

         Also, with respect to these 484,296 shares in the Plan, in the event of
         a tender offer for shares in the Plan, under the Plan each Plan
         participant may direct the trustees to tender or not tender the shares
         credited to such participant's account under the Plan. The trustees are
         obligated to follow such directions timely received. The trustees shall
         also tender a fraction of the unallocated shares held by the Plan, with
         the numerator of the fraction equal to the number of shares allocated
         to participants' accounts for which the

                                  Schedule 13D



         trustees have received instructions from participants to tender and the
         denominator of the fraction equal to the total number of shares
         allocated to participants' accounts. Although the trustees do not 
         normally trade shares, under certain circumstances a participant may
         give instructions regarding such participant's account which may result
         in the transfer of shares by the trustees.

         (c)     Not Applicable

         (d)     Not Applicable.

         (e)     Not Applicable.
